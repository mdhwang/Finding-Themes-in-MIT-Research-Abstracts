Analytical solutions are obtained for the normalized state equations of coupled second-order chaotic transmitter and receiver systems embedding the information signal. The analytical solution of the difference system obtained from the state equations of the transmitter and receiver systems has been identified as a measure of the recovered information signal which is transmitted securely by chaotic masking. The analytical solutions are used to reveal the nature of synchronization and the enhancement of the amplitude of recovered information signal. The difference signal of the coupled state variables indicating the recovered information signal obtained through numerical simulations is presented to validate the analytical results. The electronic circuit experimental results are presented to confirm the analytical and numerical results of the communication scheme discussed.\n",

      "        Uncertainty analysis in the form of probabilistic forecasting can significantly improve decision making processes in the smart power grid when integrating renewable energy sources such as wind. Whereas point forecasting provides a single expected value, probabilistic forecasts provide more information in the form of quantiles, prediction intervals, or full predictive densities. Traditionally quantile regression is applied for such forecasting and recently quantile regression neural networks have become popular for weather and renewable energy forecasting. However, one major shortcoming of composite quantile estimation in neural networks is the quantile crossover problem. This paper analyzes the effectiveness of a novel smoothed loss and penalty function for neural network architectures to prevent the quantile crossover problem. Its efficacy is examined on the wind power forecasting problem. A numerical case study is conducted using publicly available wind data from the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014. Multiple quantiles are estimated to form 10\\%, to 90\\% prediction intervals which are evaluated using a quantile score and reliability measures. Benchmark models such as the persistence and climatology distributions, multiple quantile regression, and support vector quantile regression are used for comparison where results demonstrate the proposed approach leads to improved performance while preventing the problem of overlapping quantile estimates.\n",

      "        This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based error correction coding scheme for AWGN channels under the constraint of one-bit quantization in the receivers. Specifically, it is first shown that the optimum error correction code that minimizes the probability of bit error can be obtained by perfectly training a special autoencoder, in which \"perfectly\" refers to converging the global minima. However, perfect training is not possible in most cases. To approach the performance of a perfectly trained autoencoder with a suboptimum training, we propose utilizing turbo codes as an implicit regularization, i.e., using a concatenation of a turbo code and an autoencoder. It is empirically shown that this design gives nearly the same performance as to the hypothetically perfectly trained autoencoder, and we also provide a theoretical proof of why that is so. The proposed coding method is as bandwidth efficient as the integrated (outer) turbo code, since the autoencoder exploits the excess bandwidth from pulse shaping and packs signals more intelligently thanks to sparsity in neural networks. Our results show that the proposed coding scheme at finite block lengths outperforms conventional turbo codes even for QPSK modulation. Furthermore, the proposed coding method can make one-bit quantization operational even for 16-QAM.\n",

      "        The penalized least squares (PLS) is a classic method to inverse problems, where a regularization term is added to stabilize the solution. Optimal transport (OT) is another mathematical framework for computer vision tasks that provides means to transport one measure to another at minimal cost. The cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (cycleGAN) is a recent extension of GAN to learn target distributions with less mode collapsing behavior. Although similar in that no supervised training is required, the algorithms look different, so the mathematical relationship between these approaches is not clear. In this article, we provide an important advance to unveil the missing link. Specifically, we reveal that a cycleGAN architecture is originated from formulating a dual OT problem, by using the consistency constraint of PLS as a regularization term in the primal OT problem. This suggests that cycleGAN can be considered stochastic generalization of classical PLS approaches. Our derivation is so general that various types of cycleGAN architectures can be easily derived by merely changing the transport cost. As proofs of concept, we provide three distinct cycleGAN architecture for various biomedical imaging problems, such as accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), super-resolution microscopy, and low-dose x-ray computed tomography (CT). Experimental results confirm the efficacy and the flexibility of the theory.\n",

However, these methods barely take the classification criteria of the first stage into consideration in the second prediction stage. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage representation method (TSR), and convert it to a Single-Teacher Single-Student (STSS) problem in our two-stage image classification framework. We seek the nearest neighbours of the test sample to choose candidate target classes. Meanwhile, the first stage classifier is formulated as the teacher, which holds the classification scores. The samples of the candidate classes are utilized to learn a student classifier based on L2-minimization in the second stage. The student will be supervised by the teacher classifier, which approves the student only if it obtains a higher score. In actuality, the proposed framework generates a stronger classifier by staging two weaker classifiers in a novel way. The experiments conducted on several face and object databases show that our proposed framework is effective and outperforms multiple popular classification methods.\n",

To achieve better generalization with fewer training samples, SymODEN incorporates appropriate inductive bias by designing the associated computation graph in a physics-informed manner. In particular, we enforce Hamiltonian dynamics with control to learn the underlying dynamics in a transparent way, which can then be leveraged to draw insight about relevant physical aspects of the system, such as mass and potential energy. In addition, we propose a parametrization which can enforce this Hamiltonian formalism even when the generalized coordinate data is embedded in a high-dimensional space or we can only access velocity data instead of generalized momentum. This framework, by offering interpretable, physically-consistent models for physical systems, opens up new possibilities for synthesizing model-based control strategies.\n",

      "        Wireless communication requires an effective antenna synthesis that characterizes adequate infrastructures to provide the broader bandwidth and reduced interference. Antenna design with minimal signal degradation, optimal gain directive main beam to sustain minimal loss has been a hot issue among many communication engineers for several years. In this paper, the effects of eccentricity of the antenna, element-spacing, number of elliptical rings and number of elements are evaluated. For efficient antenna synthesis, deep Side Lobe Level (SLL) reduction and superior directivity are critical. We have also studied the significance of hyper beamforming in Elliptical Cylindrical Antenna Array (ECAA) in comparison to the geometric configuration of the antenna parameters (eccentricity of the antenna, element-spacing, number of elliptical rings and number of elements). The hyper beam exponent has resulted in flexible pattern synthesis while simultaneously reducing the side lobe of the proposed antenna array, thus decreasing the SLL and increasing directivity that are vital for wideband applications.\n",

      "        Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. While COPD diagnosis is based on lung function tests, early stages and progression of different aspects of the disease can be visible and quantitatively assessed on computed tomography (CT) scans. Many studies have been published that quantify imaging biomarkers related to COPD. In this paper we present a convolutional neural network that directly computes visual emphysema scores and predicts the outcome of lung function tests for 195 CT scans from the COPDGene study. Contrary to previous work, the proposed method does not encode any specific prior knowledge about what to quantify, but it is trained end-to-end with a set of 1424 CT scans for which the output parameters were available. The network provided state-of-the-art results for these tasks: Visual emphysema scores are comparable to those assessed by trained human observers; COPD diagnosis from estimated lung function reaches an area under the ROC curve of 0.94, outperforming prior art. The method is easily generalizable to other situations where information from whole scans needs to be summarized in single quantities.\n",

In our approach, PCG is first voxelized, scaled and partitioned into non-overlapped 3D cubes, which is then fed into stacked 3D convolutions for compact latent feature and hyperprior generation. Hyperpriors are used to improve the conditional probability modeling of latent features. A weighted binary cross-entropy (WBCE) loss is applied in training while an adaptive thresholding is used in inference to remove unnecessary voxels and reduce the distortion. Objectively, our method exceeds the geometry-based point cloud compression (G-PCC) algorithm standardized by well-known Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) with a significant performance margin, e.g., at least 60% BD-Rate (Bjontegaard Delta Rate) gains, using common test datasets. Subjectively, our method has presented better visual quality with smoother surface reconstruction and appealing details, in comparison to all existing MPEG standard compliant PCC methods. Our method requires about 2.5MB parameters in total, which is a fairly small size for practical implementation, even on embedded platform. Additional ablation studies analyze a variety of aspects (e.g., cube size, kernels, etc) to explore the application potentials of our learned-PCGC.\n",

For this, we demonstrate how this binary vector can be relaxed to a soft-valued vector, facilitating the learning process through gradient descent and enabling an efficient code construction. We further show how different polar code design constraints (e.g., code rate) can be taken into account by means of careful binary-to-soft and soft-to-binary conversions, along with rate-adjustment after each learning iteration. Besides its conceptual simplicity, this approach benefits from having the \"decoder-in-the-loop\", i.e., the nature of the decoder is inherently taken into consideration while learning (designing) the polar code. We show results for belief propagation (BP) decoding over both AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels with considerable performance gains over state-of-the-art construction schemes.\n",

      "        Electromagnetic Navigation Systems (eMNS) can be used to control a variety of multiscale devices within the human body for remote surgery. Accurate modeling of the magnetic fields generated by the electromagnets of an eMNS is crucial for the precise control of these devices. Existing methods assume a linear behavior of these systems, leading to significant modeling errors within nonlinear regions exhibited at higher magnetic fields. In this paper, we use a random forest (RF) and an artificial neural network (ANN) to model the nonlinear behavior of the magnetic fields generated by an eMNS. Both machine learning methods outperformed the state-of-the-art linear multipole electromagnet method (LMEM). The RF and the ANN model reduced the root mean squared error of the LMEM when predicting the field magnitude by around 40% and 80%, respectively, over the entire current range of the eMNS. At high current regions, especially between 30 and 35 A, the field-magnitude RMSE improvement of the ANN model over the LMEM was over 35 mT. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using machine learning methods to model an eMNS for medical applications, and its ability to account for complex nonlinear behavior at high currents. The use of machine learning thus shows promise for improving surgical procedures that use magnetic navigation.\n",

      "        Exploiting multi-antenna technologies for robust beamsteering to overcome the effects of blockage and beam misalignment is the key to providing seamless multi-Gbps connectivity in millimeter-wave (mm-wave) networks. In this paper, we present the first large-scale outdoor mm-wave measurement study using a phased antenna array in a typical European town. We systematically collect fine-grained 3D angle-of-arrival (AoA) and angle-of-departure (AoD) data, totaling over 50,000 received signal strength measurements. We study the impact of phased antenna arrays in terms of number of link opportunities, achievable data rate and robustness under small-scale mobility, and compare this against reference horn antenna measurements. Our results show a limited number of 2--4 link opportunities per receiver location, indicating that the mm-wave multipath richness in a European town is surprisingly similar to that of dense urban metropolises. The results for the phased antenna array reveal that significant losses in estimated data rate occur for beam misalignments in the order of the half-power beamwidth, with significant and irregular variations for larger misalignments. By contrast, the loss for horn antennas is monotonically increasing with the misalignment. Our results strongly suggest that the effect of non-ideal phased antenna arrays must be explicitly considered in the design of agile beamsteering algorithms.\n",

      "        Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) can provide mechanical support for a failing heart as bridge to transplant and destination therapy. Physiological control systems for LVADs should be designed to respond to changes in hemodynamic across a variety of clinical scenarios and patients by automatically adjusting the heart pump speed. In this study, a novel adaptive physiological control system for an implantable heart pump was developed to respond to interpatient and intrapatient variations to maintain the left-ventricle-end-diastolic-pressure (LVEDP) in the normal range of 3 to 15 mmHg to prevent ventricle suction and pulmonary congestion. A new algorithm was also developed to detect LVEDP from pressure sensor measurement in real-time mode. Model free adaptive control (MFAC) was employed to control the pump speed via simulation of 100 different patient conditions in each of six different patient scenarios, and compared to standard PID control. Controller performance was tracked using the sum of the absolute error (SAE) between the desired and measured LVEDP. The lower SAE on control tracking performance means the measured LVEDP follows the desired LVEDP faster and with less amplitude oscillations preventing ventricle suction and pulmonary congestion (mean and standard deviation of SAE(mmHg) for all 600 simulations were 18813+-29345 and 24794+-28380 corresponding to MFAC and PID controller respectively). In four out of six patient scenarios, MFAC control tracking performance was better than the PID controller. This study shows the control performance can be guaranteed across different patients and conditions when using MFAC over PID control, which is a step towards clinical acceptance of these systems.\n",

      "        Images acquired by outdoor vision systems easily suffer poor visibility and annoying interference due to the rainy weather, which brings great challenge for accurately understanding and describing the visual contents. Recent researches have devoted great efforts on the task of rain removal for improving the image visibility. However, there is very few exploration about the quality assessment of de-rained image, even it is crucial for accurately measuring the performance of various de-raining algorithms. In this paper, we first create a de-raining quality assessment (DQA) database that collects 206 authentic rain images and their de-rained versions produced by 6 representative single image rain removal algorithms. Then, a subjective study is conducted on our DQA database, which collects the subject-rated scores of all de-rained images. To quantitatively measure the quality of de-rained image with non-uniform artifacts, we propose a bi-directional feature embedding network (B-FEN) which integrates the features of global perception and local difference together. Experiments confirm that the proposed method significantly outperforms many existing universal blind image quality assessment models. To help the research towards perceptually preferred de-raining algorithm, we will publicly release our DQA database and B-FEN source code on https://github.com/wqb-uestc.\n",

      "        In hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, spatial context has demonstrated its significance in achieving promising performance. However, conventional spatial context-based methods simply assume that spatially neighboring pixels should correspond to the same land-cover class, so they often fail to correctly discover the contextual relations among pixels in complex situations, and thus leading to imperfect classification results on some irregular or inhomogeneous regions such as class boundaries. To address this deficiency, we develop a new HSI classification method based on the recently proposed Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), as it can flexibly encode the relations among arbitrarily structured non-Euclidean data. Different from traditional GCN, there are two novel strategies adopted by our method to further exploit the contextual relations for accurate HSI classification. First, since the receptive field of traditional GCN is often limited to fairly small neighborhood, we proposed to capture long range contextual relations in HSI by performing successive graph convolutions on a learned region-induced graph which is transformed from the original 2D image grids. Second, we refine the graph edge weight and the connective relationships among image regions by learning the improved adjacency matrix and the 'edge filter', so that the graph can be gradually refined to adapt to the representations generated by each graph convolutional layer. Such updated graph will in turn result in accurate region representations, and vice versa. The experiments carried out on three real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method yields significant improvement in the classification performance when compared with some state-of-the-art approaches.\n",

      "        Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have drawn great attention in image super-resolution (SR). Recently, visual attention mechanism, which exploits both of the feature importance and contextual cues, has been introduced to image SR and proves to be effective to improve CNN-based SR performance. In this paper, we make a thorough investigation on the attention mechanisms in a SR model and shed light on how simple and effective improvements on these ideas improve the state-of-the-arts. We further propose a unified approach called \"multi-grained attention networks (MGAN)\" which fully exploits the advantages of multi-scale and attention mechanisms in SR tasks. In our method, the importance of each neuron is computed according to its surrounding regions in a multi-grained fashion and then is used to adaptively re-scale the feature responses. More importantly, the \"channel attention\" and \"spatial attention\" strategies in previous methods can be essentially considered as two special cases of our method. We also introduce multi-scale dense connections to extract the image features at multiple scales and capture the features of different layers through dense skip connections. Ablation studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. In comparison with other state-of-the-art SR methods, our method shows the superiority in terms of both accuracy and model size.\n",

      "        Objective: Recognizing retinal vessel abnormity is vital to early diagnosis of ophthalmological diseases and cardiovascular events. However, segmentation results are highly influenced by elusive vessels, especially in low-contrast background and lesion region. In this work, we present an end-to-end synthetic neural network, containing a symmetric equilibrium generative adversarial network (SEGAN), multi-scale features refine blocks (MSFRB), and attention mechanism (AM) to enhance the performance on vessel segmentation. Method: The proposed network is granted powerful multi-scale representation capability to extract detail information. First, SEGAN constructs a symmetric adversarial architecture, which forces generator to produce more realistic images with local details. Second, MSFRB are devised to prevent high-resolution features from being obscured, thereby merging multi-scale features better. Finally, the AM is employed to encourage the network to concentrate on discriminative features. Results: On public dataset DRIVE, STARE, CHASEDB1, and HRF, we evaluate our network quantitatively and compare it with state-of-the-art works. The ablation experiment shows that SEGAN, MSFRB, and AM both contribute to the desirable performance. Conclusion: The proposed network outperforms the mature methods and effectively functions in elusive vessels segmentation, achieving highest scores in Sensitivity, G-Mean, Precision, and F1-Score while maintaining the top level in other metrics. Significance: The appreciable performance and computational efficiency offer great potential in clinical retinal vessel segmentation application.

This study aimed to understand the improvement for vocoded speech intelligibility in cochlear implant (CI) simulation through two potential methods: Speech Enhancement (SE) and Audiovisual Integration. A fully convolutional neural network (FCN) using an intelligibility-oriented objective function was recently proposed and proven to effectively facilitate the speech intelligibility as an advanced SE approach. Furthermore, the audiovisual integration is reported to supply better speech comprehension compared to audio-only information. An experiment was designed to test speech intelligibility using tone-vocoded speech in CI simulation with a group of normal-hearing listeners. Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the FCN-based SE and audiovisual integration and positively recommended these two methods becoming a blended feature in a CI processor to increase the speech intelligibility for CI users under noisy conditions.\n",

      "        Acquisition of data in task-specific applications of machine learning like plant disease recognition is a costly endeavor owing to the requirements of professional human diligence and time constraints. In this paper, we present a simple pipeline that uses GANs in an unsupervised image translation environment to improve learning with respect to the data distribution in a plant disease dataset, reducing the partiality introduced by acute class imbalance and hence shifting the classification decision boundary towards better performance. The empirical analysis of our method is demonstrated on a limited dataset of 2789 tomato plant disease images, highly corrupted with an imbalance in the 9 disease categories. First, we extend the state of the art for the GAN-based image-to-image translation method by enhancing the perceptual quality of the generated images and preserving the semantics. We introduce AR-GAN, where in addition to the adversarial loss, our synthetic image generator optimizes on Activation Reconstruction loss (ARL) function that optimizes feature activations against the natural image. We present visually more compelling synthetic images in comparison to most prominent existing models and evaluate the performance of our GAN framework in terms of various datasets and metrics. Second, we evaluate the performance of a baseline convolutional neural network classifier for improved recognition using the resulting synthetic samples to augment our training set and compare it with the classical data augmentation scheme. We observe a significant improvement in classification accuracy (+5.2%) using generated synthetic samples as compared to (+0.8%) increase using classic augmentation in an equal class distribution environment.\n",

      "        The combined electric and acoustic stimulation (EAS) has demonstrated better speech recognition than conventional cochlear implant (CI) and yielded satisfactory performance under quiet conditions. However, when noise signals are involved, both the electric signal and the acoustic signal may be distorted, thereby resulting in poor recognition performance. To suppress noise effects, speech enhancement (SE) is a necessary unit in EAS devices. Recently, a time-domain speech enhancement algorithm based on the fully convolutional neural networks (FCN) with a short-time objective intelligibility (STOI)-based objective function (termed FCN(S) in short) has received increasing attention due to its simple structure and effectiveness of restoring clean speech signals from noisy counterparts. With evidence showing the benefits of FCN(S) for normal speech, this study sets out to assess its ability to improve the intelligibility of EAS simulated speech. Objective evaluations and listening tests were conducted to examine the performance of FCN(S) in improving the speech intelligibility of normal and vocoded speech in noisy environments. The experimental results show that, compared with the traditional minimum-mean square-error SE method and the deep denoising autoencoder SE method, FCN(S) can obtain better gain in the speech intelligibility for normal as well as vocoded speech. This study, being the first to evaluate deep learning SE approaches for EAS, confirms that FCN(S) is an effective SE approach that may potentially be integrated into an EAS processor to benefit users in noisy environments.\n",

      "        In recent years, waveform-mapping-based speech enhancement (SE) methods have garnered significant attention. These methods generally use a deep learning model to directly process and reconstruct speech waveforms. Because both the input and output are in waveform format, the waveform-mapping-based SE methods can overcome the distortion caused by imperfect phase estimation, which may be encountered in spectral-mapping-based SE systems. So far, most waveform-mapping-based SE methods have focused on single-channel tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel fully convolutional network (FCN) with Sinc and dilated convolutional layers (termed SDFCN) for multichannel SE that operates in the time domain. We also propose an extended version of SDFCN, called the residual SDFCN (termed rSDFCN). The proposed methods are evaluated on two multichannel SE tasks, namely the dual-channel inner-ear microphones SE task and the distributed microphones SE task. The experimental results confirm the outstanding denoising capability of the proposed SE systems on both tasks and the benefits of using the residual architecture on the overall SE performance.\n",

      "        Existing works on control of tractor-trailers systems only consider the kinematics model without taking dynamics into account. Also, most of them treat the issue as a pure control theory problem whose solutions are difficult to implement. This paper presents a trajectory tracking control approach for a full-scale industrial tractor-trailers vehicle composed of a car-like tractor and arbitrary number of passive full trailers. To deal with dynamic effects of trailing units, a force sensor is innovatively installed at the connection between the tractor and the first trailer to measure the forces acting on the tractor. The tractor's dynamic model that explicitly accounts for the measured forces is derived. A tracking controller that compensates the pulling/pushing forces in real time and simultaneously drives the system onto desired trajectories is proposed. The propulsion map between throttle opening and the propulsion force is proposed to be modeled with a fifth-order polynomial. The parameters are estimated by fitting experimental data, in order to provide accurate driving force. Stability of the control algorithm is rigorously proved by Lyapunov methods. Experiments of full-size vehicles are conducted to validate the performance of the control approach.\n",

      "        Voice activity detection (VAD), which classifies frames as speech or non-speech, is an important module in many speech applications including speaker verification. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called self-adaptive soft VAD, to incorporate a deep neural network (DNN)-based VAD into a deep speaker embedding system. The proposed method is a combination of the following two approaches. The first approach is soft VAD, which performs a soft selection of frame-level features extracted from a speaker feature extractor. The frame-level features are weighted by their corresponding speech posteriors estimated from the DNN-based VAD, and then aggregated to generate a speaker embedding. The second approach is self-adaptive VAD, which fine-tunes the pre-trained VAD on the speaker verification data to reduce the domain mismatch. Here, we introduce two unsupervised domain adaptation (DA) schemes, namely speech posterior-based DA (SP-DA) and joint learning-based DA (JL-DA). Experiments on a Korean speech database demonstrate that the verification performance is improved significantly in real-world environments by using self-adaptive soft VAD.\n",

      "        In recent years, mobile devices are equipped with increasingly advanced sensing and computing capabilities. Coupled with advancements in Deep Learning (DL), this opens up countless possibilities for meaningful applications. Traditional cloudbased Machine Learning (ML) approaches require the data to be centralized in a cloud server or data center. However, this results in critical issues related to unacceptable latency and communication inefficiency. To this end, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been proposed to bring intelligence closer to the edge, where data is produced. However, conventional enabling technologies for ML at mobile edge networks still require personal data to be shared with external parties, e.g., edge servers. Recently, in light of increasingly stringent data privacy legislations and growing privacy concerns, the concept of Federated Learning (FL) has been introduced. In FL, end devices use their local data to train an ML model required by the server. The end devices then send the model updates rather than raw data to the server for aggregation. FL can serve as an enabling technology in mobile edge networks since it enables the collaborative training of an ML model and also enables DL for mobile edge network optimization. However, in a large-scale and complex mobile edge network, heterogeneous devices with varying constraints are involved. This raises challenges of communication costs, resource allocation, and privacy and security in the implementation of FL at scale. In this survey, we begin with an introduction to the background and fundamentals of FL. Then, we highlight the aforementioned challenges of FL implementation and review existing solutions. Furthermore, we present the applications of FL for mobile edge network optimization. Finally, we discuss the important challenges and future research directions in FL\n",

      "        Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death across the world in women. Early diagnosis of this type of cancer is critical for treatment and patient care. Computer-aided detection (CAD) systems using convolutional neural networks (CNN) could assist in the classification of abnormalities. In this study, we proposed an ensemble deep learning-based approach for automatic binary classification of breast histology images. The proposed ensemble model adapts three pre-trained CNNs, namely VGG19, MobileNet, and DenseNet. The ensemble model is used for the feature representation and extraction steps. The extracted features are then fed into a multi-layer perceptron classifier to carry out the classification task. Various pre-processing and CNN tuning techniques such as stain-normalization, data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and fine-tuning are used to train the model. The proposed method is validated on four publicly available benchmark datasets, i.e., ICIAR, BreakHis, PatchCamelyon, and Bioimaging. The proposed multi-model ensemble method obtains better predictions than single classifiers and machine learning algorithms with accuracies of 98.13%, 95.00%, 94.64% and 83.10% for BreakHis, ICIAR, PatchCamelyon and Bioimaging datasets, respectively.\n",

To tackle this issue, an automatic and robust diagnostic system is required for early detection and treatment. In this paper, an automated deep learning-based method is proposed to distinguish between immature leukemic blasts and normal cells. The proposed deep learning based hybrid method, which is enriched by different data augmentation techniques, is able to extract high-level features from input images. Results demonstrate that the proposed model yields better prediction than individual models for Leukemic B-lymphoblast classification with 96.17% overall accuracy, 95.17% sensitivity and 98.58% specificity. Fusing the features extracted from intermediate layers, our approach has the potential to improve the overall classification performance.\n",

      "        In recent years, single image super-resolution (SISR) methods using deep convolution neural network (CNN) have achieved impressive results. Thanks to the powerful representation capabilities of the deep networks, numerous previous ways can learn the complex non-linear mapping between low-resolution (LR) image patches and their high-resolution (HR) versions. However, excessive convolutions will limit the application of super-resolution technology in low computing power devices. Besides, super-resolution of any arbitrary scale factor is a critical issue in practical applications, which has not been well solved in the previous approaches. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight information multi-distillation network (IMDN) by constructing the cascaded information multi-distillation blocks (IMDB), which contains distillation and selective fusion parts. Specifically, the distillation module extracts hierarchical features step-by-step, and fusion module aggregates them according to the importance of candidate features, which is evaluated by the proposed contrast-aware channel attention mechanism. To process real images with any sizes, we develop an adaptive cropping strategy (ACS) to super-resolve block-wise image patches using the same well-trained model. Extensive experiments suggest that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art SR algorithms in term of visual quality, memory footprint, and inference time.

      "        Use expert visualization or conventional clinical indices can lack accuracy for borderline classications. Advanced statistical approaches based on eigen-decomposition have been mostly concerned with shape and motion indices. In this paper, we present a new approach to identify CVDs from cine-MRI by estimating large pools of radiomic features (statistical, shape and textural features) encoding relevant changes in anatomical and image characteristics due to CVDs. The calculated cine-MRI radiomic features are assessed using sequential forward feature selection to identify the most relevant ones for given CVD classes (e.g. myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, abnormal right ventricle). Finally, advanced machine learning is applied to suitably integrate the selected radiomics for final multi-feature classification based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The proposed technique was trained and cross-validated using 100 cine-MRI cases corresponding to five different cardiac classes from the ACDC MICCAI 2017 challenge \\footnote{https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/Challenge/acdc/index.html}. All cases were correctly classified in this preliminary study, indicating potential of using large-scale radiomics for MRI-based diagnosis of CVDs.\n",

The model generalizes the linear threshold model (LTM) from the literature, where an agent becomes active (adopts an innovation) if the fraction of its neighbors that are active is above a threshold. With the CTM we study the influence on cascades of heterogeneity in thresholds for a network comprised of a chain of three clusters of agents, each distinguished by a different threshold. The system is most sensitive to change as the dynamics pass through a bifurcation point: if the bifurcation is supercritical the response will be contained, while if the bifurcation is subcritical the response will be a cascade. We show that there is a subcritical bifurcation, thus a cascade, in response to an innovation if there is a large enough disparity between the thresholds of sufficiently large clusters on either end of the chain; otherwise the response will be contained.\n",

The focus of this paper is the analysis of 4D Respiratory Correlated Computed Tomography (RCCT) Imaging. It is hypothesized that the quasi-periodic breathing induced motion of organs in the thorax can be represented by deformations spanning a very low dimension subspace of the full infinite dimensional space of diffeomorphic transformations. This paper presents a novel motion estimation algorithm that includes the constraint for low-rank motion between the different phases of the RCCT images. Low-rank deformation solutions are necessary for the efficient statistical analysis and improved treatment planning and delivery. Although the application focus of this paper is RCCT the algorithm is quite general and applicable to various motion estimation problems in medical imaging.\n",

To avoid this drawback of DP, we consider datasets containing almost periodic time series, composed of periodic components and noisy variations on top that are independent across periods. Our interest in these datasets is motivated by that, for reporting on private periodic time series, we do not need to divide the privacy budget across the entire, possibly infinite, horizon. Instead, for periodic time series, we generate DP reports for the first period and report the same DP reports periodically. In practice, however, exactly periodic time series do not exist as the data always contains small variations due to random or uncertain events. For instance, the energy consumption of a household may repeat the same daily pattern with slight variations due to minor changes to the habits of the individuals. The underlying periodic pattern is a function of the private information of the households. It might be desired to protect the privacy of households by not leaking information about the recurring patterns while the individual daily variations are almost noise-like with little to no privacy concerns (depending on the situation). Motivated by this, we define DP for almost periodic datasets and develop a Laplace mechanism for responding to linear queries. We provide statistical tools for testing the validity of almost periodicity assumption. We use multiple energy datasets containing smart-meter measurements of households to validate almost periodicity assumption. We generate DP aggregate reports and investigate their utility.\n",

      "        Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) benefits from detection and classification of interference sources including in-network users, out-network users, and jammers that may all coexist in a wireless network. We present a deep learning based signal (modulation) classification solution in a realistic wireless network setting, where 1) signal types may change over time; 2) some signal types may be unknown for which there is no training data; 3) signals may be spoofed such as the smart jammers replaying other signal types; and 4) different signal types may be superimposed due to the interference from concurrent transmissions. For case 1, we apply continual learning and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using an Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) based loss. For case 2, we detect unknown signals via outlier detection applied to the outputs of convolutional layers using Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD) and k-means clustering methods. For case 3, we extend the CNN structure to capture phase shifts due to radio hardware effects to identify the spoofing signal sources. For case 4, we apply blind source separation using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to separate interfering signals. We utilize the signal classification results in a distributed scheduling protocol, where in-network (secondary) users employ signal classification scores to make channel access decisions and share the spectrum with each other while avoiding interference with out-network (primary) users and jammers. Compared with benchmark TDMA-based schemes, we show that distributed scheduling constructed upon signal classification results provides major improvements to in-network user throughput and out-network user success ratio.\n",

      "        This paper considers the synthesis of optimal safe controllers based on density functions. We present an algorithm for robust constrained optimal control synthesis using the duality relationship between the density function and the value function. The density function follows the Liouville equation and is the dual of the value function, which satisfies Bellman's optimality principle. Thanks to density functions, constraints over the distribution of states, such as safety constraints, can be posed straightforwardly in an optimal control problem. The constrained optimal control problem is then solved with a primal-dual algorithm. This formulation is extended to the case with external disturbances, and we show that the robust constrained optimal control can be solved with a modified primal-dual algorithm. We apply this formulation to the problem of finding the optimal safe controller that minimizes the cumulative intervention. An adaptive cruise control (ACC) example is used to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed, wherein we compare the result of the density function approach with the conventional control barrier function (CBF) method.\n",

      "        Imaging is an important means by which information is gathered regarding the physical world. Spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio are underpinning concepts. There is a paucity of rigorous definitions for these quantities, which are general enough to be useful in a broad range of imaging problems, while being also sufficiently specific to enable precise quantitative evaluation of the relevant properties of imaging systems. This is particularly true for many modern forms of imaging that include digital processing of the acquired imaging data as an integral step leading to final images presented to an end-user. Here, both the well-known historical definitions of spatial resolution and some more recent approaches suitable for many forms of modern computational imaging are discussed. An intrinsic duality of spatial resolution and signal-to-noise exists in almost all types of imaging, with the related uncertainty relationship determining a trade-off between the two quantities. Examples are presented with applications to super-resolution imaging, inline holography and ghost imaging.\n",

      "        This study proposes a deep learning model that effectively suppresses the false alarms in the intensive care units (ICUs) without ignoring the true alarms using single- and multimodal biosignals. Most of the current work in the literature are either rule-based methods, requiring prior knowledge of arrhythmia analysis to build rules, or classical machine learning approaches, depending on hand-engineered features. In this work, we apply convolutional neural networks to automatically extract time-invariant features, an attention mechanism to put more emphasis on the important regions of the input segmented signal(s) that are more likely to contribute to an alarm, and long short-term memory units to capture the temporal information presented in the signal segments. We trained our method efficiently using a two-step training algorithm (i.e., pre-training and fine-tuning the proposed network) on the dataset provided by the PhysioNet computing in cardiology challenge 2015. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method obtains better results compared to other existing algorithms for the false alarm reduction task in ICUs. The proposed method achieves a sensitivity of 93.88% and a specificity of 92.05% for the alarm classification, considering three different signals. In addition, our experiments for 5 separate alarm types leads significant results, where we just consider a single-lead ECG (e.g., a sensitivity of 90.71%, a specificity of 88.30%, an AUC of 89.51 for alarm type of Ventricular Tachycardia arrhythmia)\n",

      "        Emerging applications of control, estimation, and machine learning, ranging from target tracking to decentralized model fitting, pose resource constraints that limit which of the available sensors, actuators, or data can be simultaneously used across time. Therefore, many researchers have proposed solutions within discrete optimization frameworks where the optimization is performed over finite sets. By exploiting notions of discrete convexity, such as submodularity, the researchers have been able to provide scalable algorithms with provable suboptimality bounds. In this paper, we consider such problems but in adversarial environments, where in every step a number of the chosen elements in the optimization is removed due to failures/attacks. Specifically, we consider for the first time a sequential version of the problem that allows us to observe the failures and adapt, while the attacker also adapts to our response. We call the novel problem Robust Sequential submodular Maximization (RSM). Generally, the problem is computationally hard and no scalable algorithm is known for its solution. However, in this paper we propose Robust and Adaptive Maximization (RAM), the first scalable algorithm. RAM runs in an online fashion, adapting in every step to the history of failures. Also, it guarantees a near-optimal performance, even against any number of failures among the used elements. Particularly, RAM has both provable per-instance a priori bounds and tight and/or optimal a posteriori bounds. Finally, we demonstrate RAM's near-optimality in simulations across various application scenarios, along with its robustness against several failure types, from worst-case to random.\n",

      "        In order to build language technologies for majority of the languages, it is important to leverage the resources available in public domain on the internet - commonly referred to as `Found Data'. However, such data is characterized by the presence of non-standard, non-trivial variations. For instance, speech resources found on the internet have non-speech content, such as music. Therefore, speech recognition and speech synthesis models need to be robust to such variations. In this work, we present an analysis to show that it is important to disentangle the latent causal factors of variation in the original data to accomplish these tasks. Based on this, we present approaches to disentangle such variations from the data using Latent Stochastic Models. Specifically, we present a method to split the latent prior space into continuous representations of dominant speech modes present in the magnitude spectra of audio signals. We propose a completely unsupervised approach using multinode latent space variational autoencoders (VAE). We show that the constraints on the latent space of a VAE can be in-fact used to separate speech and music, independent of the language of the speech. This paper also analytically presents the requirement on the number of latent variables for the task based on distribution of the speech data.\n",

      "        Cone-beam breast computed tomography (CT) provides true 3D breast images with isotropic resolution and high-contrast information, detecting calcifications as small as a few hundred microns and revealing subtle tissue differences. However, breast is highly sensitive to x-ray radiation. It is critically important for healthcare to reduce radiation dose. Few-view cone-beam CT only uses a fraction of x-ray projection data acquired by standard cone-beam breast CT, enabling significant reduction of the radiation dose. However, insufficient sampling data would cause severe streak artifacts in CT images reconstructed using conventional methods. In this study, we propose a deep-learning-based method to establish a residual neural network model for the image reconstruction, which is applied for few-view breast CT to produce high quality breast CT images. We respectively evaluate the deep-learning-based image reconstruction using one third and one quarter of x-ray projection views of the standard cone-beam breast CT. Based on clinical breast imaging dataset, we perform a supervised learning to train the neural network from few-view CT images to corresponding full-view CT images. Experimental results show that the deep learning-based image reconstruction method allows few-view breast CT to achieve a radiation dose &lt;6 mGy per cone-beam CT scan, which is a threshold set by FDA for mammographic screening.\n",

      "        The high penetration of photovoltaic (PV) is reshaping the electricity net-load curve and has a significant impact on power system operation and planning. The concept of duck curve is widely used to describe the timing imbalance between peak demand and PV generation. The traditional duck curve is deterministic and only shows a single extreme or typical scenario during a day. Thus, it cannot capture both the probability of that scenario and the uncertainty of PV generation and loads. These weaknesses limit the application of the duck curve on power system planning under high PV penetration. To address this issue, the novel concepts of probabilistic duck curve (PDC) and probabilistic ramp curve (PRC) are proposed to accurately model the uncertainty and variability of electricity net load and ramp under high PV penetration. An efficient method is presented for modeling PDC and PRC using kernel density estimation, copula function, and dependent discrete convolution. Several indices are designed to quantify the characteristics of the PDC and PRC. For the application, we demonstrate how the PDC and PRC will benefit flexible resource planning. Finally, an empirical study on the Qinghai provincial power system of China validates the effectiveness of the presented method. The results of PDC and PRC intuitively illustrate that the ramp demand and the valley of net load face considerable uncertainty under high PV penetration. The results of flexible resource planning indicate that retrofitting coal-fired units has remarkable performance on enhancing the power system flexibility in Qinghai. In average, reducing the minimal output of coal-fired units by 1 MW will increase PV accommodation by over 4 MWh each day.\n",

      "        Generative adversarial networks have seen rapid development in recent years and have led to remarkable improvements in generative modelling of images. However, their application in the audio domain has received limited attention, and autoregressive models, such as WaveNet, remain the state of the art in generative modelling of audio signals such as human speech. To address this paucity, we introduce GAN-TTS, a Generative Adversarial Network for Text-to-Speech. Our architecture is composed of a conditional feed-forward generator producing raw speech audio, and an ensemble of discriminators which operate on random windows of different sizes. The discriminators analyse the audio both in terms of general realism, as well as how well the audio corresponds to the utterance that should be pronounced. To measure the performance of GAN-TTS, we employ both subjective human evaluation (MOS - Mean Opinion Score), as well as novel quantitative metrics (Fréchet DeepSpeech Distance and Kernel DeepSpeech Distance), which we find to be well correlated with MOS. We show that GAN-TTS is capable of generating high-fidelity speech with naturalness comparable to the state-of-the-art models, and unlike autoregressive models, it is highly parallelisable thanks to an efficient feed-forward generator.

      "        Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is challenged by uncontrollable, large, and irregular fetal movements. It is, therefore, performed through visual monitoring of fetal motion and repeated acquisitions to ensure diagnostic-quality images are acquired. Nevertheless, visual monitoring of fetal motion based on displayed slices, and navigation at the level of stacks-of-slices is inefficient. The current process is highly operator-dependent, increases scanner usage and cost, and significantly increases the length of fetal MRI scans which makes them hard to tolerate for pregnant women. To help build automatic MRI motion tracking and navigation systems to overcome the limitations of the current process and improve fetal imaging, we have developed a new real time image-based motion tracking method based on deep learning that learns to predict fetal motion directly from acquired images. Our method is based on a recurrent neural network, composed of spatial and temporal encoder-decoders, that infers motion parameters from anatomical features extracted from sequences of acquired slices. We compared our trained network on held out test sets (including data with different characteristics, e.g. different fetuses scanned at different ages, and motion trajectories recorded from volunteer subjects) with networks designed for estimation as well as methods adopted to make predictions. The results show that our method outperformed alternative techniques, and achieved real-time performance with average errors of 3.5 and 8 degrees for the estimation and prediction tasks, respectively. Our real-time deep predictive motion tracking technique can be used to assess fetal movements, to guide slice acquisitions, and to build navigation systems for fetal MRI.\n",

However, realization of stable and effective wireless power transfer for freely positioned receivers is technically challenging task because of the requirement of complex control and tuning. In this paper, we propose a concept of automatic receiver tracking and power channeling for multi-transmitter WPT systems using uncoupled transmitter and uncoupled repeaters. Each transmitter-repeater pair forms an independent power transfer channel providing an effective link for the power flow from the transmitter to the receiver. The proposed WPT system is capable of maintaining stable output power with constant high efficiency regardless of the receiver position and without having any active control or tuning. The proposed concept is numerically and experimentally verified by using a four-transmitter WPT system in form of a linear array. The experimental results show that the efficiency of the proposed WPT system can reach 94.5\\% with a variation less than 2\\% against the receiver position.\n",

In those scenarios, the movements of served user equipments (UEs) are inevitable, so the UAV-BSs needs to be re-positioned dynamically for providing seamless services. In this paper, we propose a system framework consisting of UEs clustering, UAV-BS placement, UEs trajectories prediction, and UAV-BS reposition matching scheme, to serve the UEs seamlessly as well as minimize the energy cost of UAV-BSs' reposition trajectories. An Echo State Network (ESN) based algorithm for predicting the future trajectories of UEs and a Kuhn-Munkres-based algorithm for finding the energy-efficient reposition trajectories of UAV-BSs is designed, respectively. We conduct a simulation using a real open dataset for performance validation. The simulation results indicate that the proposed framework achieves high prediction accuracy and provides the energy-efficient matching scheme.\n",

Deep learning advances however have also been employed to create software that can cause threats to privacy, democracy and national security. One of those deep learning-powered applications recently emerged is \"deepfake\". Deepfake algorithms can create fake images and videos that humans cannot distinguish them from authentic ones. The proposal of technologies that can automatically detect and assess the integrity of digital visual media is therefore indispensable. This paper presents a survey of algorithms used to create deepfakes and, more importantly, methods proposed to detect deepfakes in the literature to date. We present extensive discussions on challenges, research trends and directions related to deepfake technologies. By reviewing the background of deepfakes and state-of-the-art deepfake detection methods, this study provides a comprehensive overview of deepfake techniques and facilitates the development of new and more robust methods to deal with the increasingly challenging deepfakes.\n",

      "        It has been 20 years since the concept of cognitive radio (CR) was proposed, which is an efficient approach to provide more access opportunities to connect massive wireless devices. To improve the spectrum efficiency, CR enables unlicensed usage of licensed spectrum resources. It has been regarded as the key enabler for intelligent communications. In this article, we will provide an overview on the intelligent communication in the past two decades to illustrate the revolution of its capability from cognition to artificial intelligence (AI). Particularly, this article starts from a comprehensive review of typical spectrum sensing and sharing, followed by the recent achievements on the AI-enabled intelligent radio. Moreover, research challenges in the future intelligent communications will be discussed to show a path to the real deployment of intelligent radio. After witnessing the glorious developments of CR in the past 20 years, we try to provide readers a clear picture on how intelligent radio could be further developed to smartly utilize the limited spectrum resources as well as to optimally configure wireless devices in the future communication systems.\n",

To go beyond linear in the online setting, nonparametric methods are of interest due to their universality and ability to stably incorporate new information via convexity or Bayes' Rule. Unfortunately, when used online, nonparametric methods suffer a \"curse of dimensionality\" which precludes their use: their complexity scales at least with the time index. We survey online compression tools which bring their memory under control and attain approximate convergence. The asymptotic bias depends on a compression parameter that trades off memory and accuracy. Further, the applications to robotics, communications, economics, and power are discussed, as well as extensions to multi-agent systems.\n",

      "        In this paper, we consider an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted cellular system which consists of multiple UAV base stations (BSs) cooperating the terrestrial BSs. In such a heterogeneous network, for cellular operators, the problem is how to determine the appropriate number, locations, and altitudes of UAV-BSs to improve the system sumrate as well as satisfy the demands of arbitrarily flash crowds on data rates. We propose a data-driven 3D placement of UAV-BSs for providing an effective placement result with a feasible computational cost. The proposed algorithm searches for the appropriate number, location, coverage, and altitude of each UAV-BS in the serving area with the maximized system sumrate in polynomial time so as to guarantee the minimum data rate requirement of UE. The simulation results show that the proposed approach can improve system sumrate in comparison with the case without UAV-BSs.\n",

      "        Broadcasting and streaming services still suffer from various levels of accessibility barriers for a significant portion of the population, limiting the access to information and culture, and in the most severe cases limiting the empowerment of people. This paper provides a brief overview of some of the most common accessibility barriers encountered. It then gives a short introduction to object-based audio (OBA) production and transport, focusing on the aspects relevant for lowering accessibility barriers. MPEG-H Audio is used as a concrete example of an OBA system already deployed. Two example cases (dialog enhancement and audio description) are used to demonstrate in detail the simplicity of producing MPEG-H Audio content providing improved accessibility. Several other possibilities are outlined briefly. We show that using OBA for broadcasting and streaming content allows offering several accessibility features in a flexible manner, requiring only small changes to the existing production workflow, assuming the receiver supports the functionality.\n",

      "        Detecting prohibited items in X-ray security imagery is pivotal in maintaining border and transport security against a wide range of threat profiles. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with the support of a significant volume of data have brought advancement in such automated prohibited object detection and classification. However, collating such large volumes of X-ray security imagery remains a significant challenge. This work opens up the possibility of using synthetically composed imagery, avoiding the need to collate such large volumes of hand-annotated real-world imagery. Here we investigate the difference in detection performance achieved using real and synthetic X-ray training imagery for CNN architecture detecting three exemplar prohibited items, {Firearm, Firearm Parts, Knives}, within cluttered and complex X-ray security baggage imagery. We achieve 0.88 of mean average precision (mAP) with a Faster R-CNN and ResNet-101 CNN architecture for this 3-class object detection using real X-ray imagery. While the performance is comparable with synthetically composited X-ray imagery (0.78 mAP), our extended evaluation demonstrates both challenge and promise of using synthetically composed images to diversify the X-ray security training imagery for automated detection algorithm training.\n",

      "        Multi-contrast MRI protocols increase the level of morphological information available for diagnosis. Yet, the number and quality of contrasts is limited in practice by various factors including scan time and patient motion. Synthesis of missing or corrupted contrasts can alleviate this limitation to improve clinical utility. Common approaches for multi-contrast MRI involve either one-to-one and many-to-one synthesis methods. One-to-one methods take as input a single source contrast, and they learn a latent representation sensitive to unique features of the source. Meanwhile, many-to-one methods receive multiple distinct sources, and they learn a shared latent representation more sensitive to common features across sources. For enhanced image synthesis, here we propose a multi-stream approach that aggregates information across multiple source images via a mixture of multiple one-to-one streams and a joint many-to-one stream. The shared feature maps generated in the many-to-one stream and the complementary feature maps generated in the one-to-one streams are combined with a fusion block. The location of the fusion block is adaptively modified to maximize task-specific performance. Qualitative and quantitative assessments on T1-, T2-, PD-weighted and FLAIR images clearly demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to previous state-of-the-art one-to-one and many-to-one methods.\n",

      "        The conventional high-level sensing techniques require high-fidelity images as input to extract target features, which are produced by either complex imaging hardware or high-complexity reconstruction algorithms. In this letter, we propose single-pixel sensing (SPS) that performs high-level sensing directly from coupled measurements of a single-pixel detector, without the conventional image acquisition and reconstruction process. The technique consists of three steps including binary light modulation that can be physically implemented at $\\sim$22kHz, single-pixel coupled detection owning wide working spectrum and high signal-to-noise ratio, and end-to-end deep-learning based sensing that reduces both hardware and software complexity. Besides, the binary modulation is trained and optimized together with the sensing network, which ensures least required measurements and optimal sensing accuracy. The effectiveness of SPS is demonstrated on the classification task of handwritten MNIST dataset, and 96.68% classification accuracy at $\\sim$1kHz is achieved. The reported single-pixel sensing technique is a novel framework for highly efficient machine intelligence.\n",

A widely examined class of flexible loads is Thermostatically Controlled Loads (TCLs), which include air conditioners, water heaters, and refrigerators. A TCL is designed to maintain a temperature within a preset band, and the actuation to achieve this is on/off. Temperature, cycling rate, and the energy bill are three main QoS metrics: exceeding the temperature limits, frequent cycling between on and off, and a high energy bill must be avoided.\n",
      "  How the temperature constraint affects the capacity of an ensemble of TCLs to provide grid support is a well studied problem. However, how the cycling constraint effects the capacity is often neglected. In this work we present a characterization of the capacity of a collection of TCLs that takes into account not only temperature, but also cycling and energy constraints. Our characterization of capacity is consistent with its most practical utility: a grid authority can use this characterization to plan a reference signal that the TCLs can track without violating any of their QoS constraints. Additionally, the proposed characterization is independent of the algorithm used to coordinate the TCLs (to provide grid support) and leads to a convex and feasible optimization problem for the grid authority's reference planning.\n",

      "        Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has widespread clinical applications from diagnosis to treatment approaches. We combined TMS with non-contact magnetic detection of TMS-evoked muscle activity in peripheral limbs to explore a new diagnostic modality that enhances the utility of TMS as a clinical tool by leveraging technological advances in magnetometry. We recorded measurements inside of a hospital using an array of optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) inside a portable shield that encompasses only the forearm and hand of the subject. We present magnetomyograms (MMG)s of TMS-evoked movement in a human hand, together with a simultaneous surface electromyograph (EMG) and electroencephalograph (EEG) data. The biomagnetic signals recorded in the MMG provides detailed spatial and temporal information that is complementary to that of the electric signal channels. Moreover, we identify features in the magnetic recording beyond that of the EMG, at time points which we further analyze in the EEG. This system demonstrates the value of biomagnetic signals in TMS-based clinical approaches and widens its availability and practical potential.\n",

A standard machine translation system is usually trained on parallel corpus composed of clean text and will perform poorly on text with recognition noise, a gap well known in speech translation community. In this paper, we propose a training architecture which aims at making a neural machine translation model more robust against speech recognition errors. Our approach addresses the encoder and the decoder simultaneously using adversarial learning and data augmentation, respectively. Experimental results on IWSLT2018 speech translation task show that our approach can bridge the gap between the ASR output and the MT input, outperforms the baseline by up to 2.83 BLEU on noisy ASR output, while maintaining close performance on clean text.\n",

A basic GAN trains a generator to represent a real-data distribution by fooling the discriminator that distinguishes real and generated data. Therefore, the basic GAN cannot represent the outside of a real-data distribution. In the case of speech perception, humans can recognize not only human voices but also processed (i.e., a non-existent human) voices as human voice. Such a human-acceptable distribution is typically wider than a real-data one and cannot be modeled by the basic GAN. To model the human-acceptable distribution, we formulate a backpropagation-based generator training algorithm by regarding human perception as a black-boxed discriminator. The training efficiently iterates generator training by using a computer and discrimination by crowdsourcing. We evaluate our HumanGAN in speech naturalness modeling and demonstrate that it can represent a human-acceptable distribution that is wider than a real-data distribution.\n",

With the aid of Eisenstein numbers, we present a novel class of LDS which can achieve error rate performances comparable to that of SCMA in Rayleigh fading channels and better performances in Gaussian channels. This is achieved by designing power-imbalanced LDS such that variation of user powers can be seen both in every chip window and the entire sequence window. As LDS-CDMA is more flexible in terms of its backwards compatibility, our proposed LDS are a promising sequence candidate for dynamic machine-type networks serving a wide range of communication devices.\n",

      "        Many medical and biological protocols for analyzing individual biological cells involve morphological evaluation based on cell staining, designed to enhance imaging contrast and enable clinicians and biologists to differentiate between various cell organelles. However, cell staining is not always allowed in certain medical procedures. In other cases, staining may be time consuming or expensive to implement. Here, we present a new deep-learning approach, called HoloStain, which converts images of isolated biological cells acquired without staining by holographic microscopy to their virtually stained images. We demonstrate this approach for human sperm cells, as there is a well-established protocol and global standardization for characterizing the morphology of stained human sperm cells for fertility evaluation, but, on the other hand, staining might be cytotoxic and thus is not allowed during human in vitro fertilization (IVF). We use deep convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) with training that is based on both the quantitative phase images and two gradient phase images, all extracted from the digital holograms of the stain-free cells, with the ground truth of bright-field images of the same cells that subsequently underwent chemical staining. To validate the quality of our virtual staining approach, an experienced embryologist analyzed the unstained cells, the virtually stained cells, and the chemically stained sperm cells several times in a blinded and randomized manner. We obtained a 5-fold recall (sensitivity) improvement in the analysis results. With the introduction of simple holographic imaging methods in clinical settings, the proposed method has a great potential to become a common practice in human IVF procedures, as well as to significantly simplify and facilitate other cell analyses and techniques such as imaging flow cytometry.\n",

In the front-end, an ICP-based edge registration can provide robust motion estimation and coarse data association under lighting changes. In the back-end, a novel edge-guided data association pipeline searches for the best photometrically matched points along geometrically possible edges through template matching, so that the matches can be further refined in later bundle adjustment. The core of our proposed data association strategy lies in a point-to-edge geometric uncertainty analysis, which analytically derives (1) the probabilistic search length formula that significantly reduces the search space for system speed-up and (2) the geometrical confidence metric for mapping degradation detection based on the predicted depth uncertainty. Moreover, match confidence based patch size adaption strategy is integrated into our pipeline, connecting with other components, to reduce the matching ambiguity. We present extensive analysis and evaluation of our proposed system on synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets under the influence of illumination changes and large camera motions, where our proposed system outperforms current state-of-art algorithms.\n",

We propose a Gaussian process-based model to jointly estimate object kinematics, including position, velocity and orientation, together with the shape of the object in an online fashion. We describe the unknown shape by a radial function in 3D, and induce a correlation structure via a Gaussian process. Furthermore, we propose an efficient algorithm to reduce the computational complexity of working with 3D data. This is accomplished by casting the tracking problem into projection planes which are attached to the object's local frame. The proposed methods provide an analytical expression for the object shape together with confidence intervals. The confidence intervals, which quantify the uncertainty in the shape estimate, can later be used for solving the gating and association problems inherent in object tracking. The performance of the methods is demonstrated both on simulated and real data. The results are compared with an existing random matrix model, which is commonly used for extended object tracking in the literature.\n",

      "        How can we efficiently compress Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) while retaining their accuracy on classification tasks? A promising direction is based on depthwise separable convolution which replaces a standard convolution with a depthwise convolution and a pointwise convolution. However, previous works based on depthwise separable convolution are limited since 1) they are mostly heuristic approaches without a precise understanding of their relations to standard convolution, and 2) their accuracies do not match that of the standard convolution. In this paper, we propose FALCON, an accurate and lightweight method for compressing CNN. FALCON is derived by interpreting existing convolution methods based on depthwise separable convolution using EHP, our proposed mathematical formulation to approximate the standard convolution kernel. Such interpretation leads to developing a generalized version rank-k FALCON which further improves the accuracy while sacrificing a bit of compression and computation reduction rates. In addition, we propose FALCON-branch by fitting FALCON into the previous state-of-the-art convolution unit ShuffleUnitV2 which gives even better accuracy. Experiments show that FALCON and FALCON-branch outperform 1) existing methods based on depthwise separable convolution and 2) standard CNN models by up to 8x compression and 8x computation reduction while ensuring similar accuracy. We also demonstrate that rank-k FALCON provides even better accuracy than standard convolution in many cases, while using a smaller number of parameters and floating-point operations.\n",

      "        Fifth-generation (5G) communication, which has many more features than fourth-generation communication, will be officially launched very soon. A new paradigm of wireless communication, the sixth-generation (6G) system, with the full support of artificial intelligence is expected to be deployed between 2027 and 2030. In beyond 5G, there are some fundamental issues, which need to be addressed are higher system capacity, higher data rate, lower latency, and improved quality of service (QoS) compared to 5G system. This paper presents the vision of future 6G wireless communication and its network architecture. We discuss the emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, terahertz communications, optical wireless technology, free space optic network, blockchain, three-dimensional networking, quantum communications, unmanned aerial vehicle, cell-free communications, integration of wireless information and energy transfer, integration of sensing and communication, integration of access-backhaul networks, dynamic network slicing, holographic beamforming, and big data analytics that can assist the 6G architecture development in guaranteeing the QoS. We present the expected applications with the requirements and the possible technologies for 6G communication. We also outline the possible challenges and research directions to reach this goal.\n",

In this paper, an IRS-enhanced wideband multiuser multi-input single-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MU-MISO-OFDM) system is investigated. We aim to jointly design the transmit beamformer and the reflection of IRS to maximize the average sum-rate over all subcarriers. With the aid of the relationship between sum-rate maximization and mean square error (MSE) minimization, an efficient joint beamformer and IRS design algorithm is developed. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed algorithm can offer significant average sum-rate enhancement, which confirms the effectiveness of the use of the IRS for wideband wireless communication systems.\n",

Previous GAN-based methods often require a large amount of high-quality training data while producing a small number (e.g., tens) of classes. This work aims to scale up GANs to thousands of classes meanwhile reducing the use of high-quality data in training. We propose an image generation method based on conditional transferring features, which can capture pixel-level semantic changes when transforming low-quality images into high-quality ones. Moreover, self-supervision learning is integrated into our GAN architecture to provide more label-free semantic supervisory information observed from the training data. As such, training our GAN architecture requires much fewer high-quality images with a small number of additional low-quality images. The experiments on CIFAR-10 and STL-10 show that even removing 30% high-quality images from the training set, our method can still outperform previous ones. The scalability on object classes has been experimentally validated: our method with 30% fewer high-quality images obtains the best quality in generating 1,000 ImageNet classes, as well as generating all 3,755 classes of CASIA-HWDB1.0 Chinese handwriting characters.\n",

      "        This paper investigates a complete blind receiver approach in an unknown multipath fading channel, which has multiple tasks including blind channel estimation, noise power estimation, modulation classification, channel coding recognition, and data detection. Each of these tasks has been sufficiently studied in the literature. However, to the best of our knowledge, this overall problem has not been investigated previously. This paper is the first attempt to address this overall problem jointly. We propose a complete blind receiver approach that jointly estimates the unknown channel state information and noise power, recognizes the unknown modulation and coding scheme, detects the data of interest, and thus named BERD receiver. Another merit of the proposed BERD receiver is that it can be implemented for both a single receiver and multiple receivers, which ensures successful estimation, recognition, and detection for such an extremely difficult problem. In addition, numerical results show the performance of the proposed receiver in three folds: a) the BERD receiver outperforms the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) pilot-based channel estimator by over 3.5 dB at the MSE of 0.01; b) the correct modulation/coding recognition performance of the BERD receiver is within 0.3 dB as close to the recognition benchmark when the perfect channel state information (CSI) is available; c) the BERD receiver is within 0.5 dB at the bit error rate of 0.001 compared to the benchmark when the modulation, the channel coding, and the CSI are perfectly known. Finally, the BERD receiver finds many applications in both civilian and military scenarios, such as the interference cancelation in spectrum sharing, real-time signal interception, and processing in electronic warfare operations, automatic recognition of a detect signal in software-defined radio.\n",

      "        The ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) is the key driver of the current 5G new radio standardization. URLLC encompasses sporadic and small-payload transmissions that should be delivered within extremely tight radio latency and reliability bounds, i.e., a radio latency of 1 ms with 99.999% success probability. However, such URLLC targets are further challenging in the 5G dynamic time division duplexing (TDD) systems, due to the switching between the uplink and downlink transmission opportunities and the additional inter-cell cross-link interference (CLI). This paper presents a system level analysis of the URLLC outage performance within the 5G new radio flexible TDD systems. Specifically, we study the feasibility of the URLLC outage targets compared to the case with the 5G frequency division duplexing (FDD), and with numerous 5G design variants. The presented results therefore offer valuable observations on the URLLC outage performance in such deployments, and hence, introducing the state-of-the-art flexible-FDD technology.\n",

      "        Automatic quantification of perifoveal vessel densities in optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) images face challenges such as variable intra- and inter-image signal to noise ratios, projection artefacts from outer vasculature layers, and motion artefacts. This study demonstrates the utility of deep neural networks for automatic quantification of foveal avascular zone (FAZ) parameters and perifoveal vessel density of OCT-A images in healthy and diabetic eyes. OCT-A images of the foveal region were acquired using three OCT-A systems: a 1060nm Swept Source (SS)-OCT prototype, RTVue XR Avanti (Optovue Inc., Fremont, CA), and the ZEISS Angioplex (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA). Automated segmentation was then performed using a deep neural network. Four FAZ morphometric parameters (area, min/max diameter, and eccentricity) and perifoveal vessel density were used as outcome measures. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the DNN vessel segmentations were comparable across all three device platforms. No significant difference between the means of the measurements from automated and manual segmentations were found for any of the outcome measures on any system. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was also good (&gt; 0.51) for all measurements.

      "        While generative adversarial networks (GANs) have revolutionized machine learning, a number of open questions remain to fully understand them and exploit their power. One of these questions is how to efficiently achieve proper diversity and sampling of the multi-mode data space. To address this, we introduce BasisGAN, a stochastic conditional multi-mode image generator. By exploiting the observation that a convolutional filter can be well approximated as a linear combination of a small set of basis elements, we learn a plug-and-played basis generator to stochastically generate basis elements, with just a few hundred of parameters, to fully embed stochasticity into convolutional filters. By sampling basis elements instead of filters, we dramatically reduce the cost of modeling the parameter space with no sacrifice on either image diversity or fidelity. To illustrate this proposed plug-and-play framework, we construct variants of BasisGAN based on state-of-the-art conditional image generation networks, and train the networks by simply plugging in a basis generator, without additional auxiliary components, hyperparameters, or training objectives. The experimental success is complemented with theoretical results indicating how the perturbations introduced by the proposed sampling of basis elements can propagate to the appearance of generated images.\n",

Recent research has focused on the development of dynamic models explaining the emergence of structural balance. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of parsimonious dynamic models for structural balance based on an interpersonal influence process. Our proposed models are gradient flows of an energy function, called the dissonance function, which captures the cognitive dissonance arising from violations of Heider's axioms. Thus, we build a new connection with the literature on energy landscape minimization. This gradient flow characterization allows us to study the transient and asymptotic behaviors of our model. We provide mathematical and numerical results describing the critical points of the dissonance function.\n",

In particular, identification of cells from two photon images demands segmentation of neural cells out of various materials and classification of the segmented cells according to their cell types. To automatically segment neural cells, we used U-Net model, followed by classification of excitatory and inhibitory neurons and glia cells using a transfer learning technique. For transfer learning, we tested three public models of resnet18, resnet50 and inceptionv3, after replacing the fully connected layer with that for three classes. The best classification performance was found for the model with inceptionv3. The proposed application of deep learning technique is expected to provide a critical way to cell identification in the era of big neuroscience data.\n",

      "        Nano drones are uniquely equipped for fully autonomous applications due to their agility, low cost, and small size. However, their constrained form factor limits flight time, sensor payload, and compute capability. While visual servoing of nano drones can achieve complex tasks, state of the art solutions have significant impact on endurance and cost. The primary goal of our work is to demonstrate phototaxis in an obstacle field, by adding only a lightweight and low-cost light sensor to a nano drone. We deploy a deep reinforcement learning model, capable of direct paths even with noisy sensor readings. By carefully designing the network input, we feed features relevant to the agent in finding the source, while reducing computational cost and enabling inference up to 100 Hz onboard the nano drone. We verify our approach with simulation and in-field testing on a Bitcraze CrazyFlie, achieving 94% success rate in cluttered and randomized test environments. The policy demonstrates efficient light seeking by reaching the goal in simulation in 65% fewer steps and with 60% shorter paths, compared to a baseline random walker algorithm.\n",

Areas of high inter-pathologist discordance and rising biopsy rates necessitate higher efficiency and diagnostic reproducibility. We present and validate a deep learning system which classifies digitized dermatopathology slides into 4 categories. The system is developed using 5,070 images from a single lab, and tested on an uncurated set of 13,537 images from 3 test labs, using whole slide scanners manufactured by 3 different vendors. The system's use of deep-learning-based confidence scoring as a criterion to consider the result as accurate yields an accuracy of up to 98\\%, and makes it adoptable in a real-world setting. Without confidence scoring, the system achieved an accuracy of 78\\%. We anticipate that our deep learning system will serve as a foundation enabling faster diagnosis of skin cancer, identification of cases for specialist review, and targeted diagnostic classifications.\n",

      "        In this paper a novel framework to tackle speaker recognition using a two-stage attention model is proposed. In recent years, the use of deep neural networks, such as time delay neural network (TDNN), and attention model have boosted speaker recognition performance. However, it is still a challenging task to tackle speaker recognition in severe acoustic environments. To build a robust speaker recognition system against noise, we employ a two-stage attention model and combine it with a TDNN model. In this framework, the attention mechanism is used in two aspects: embedding space and temporal space. The embedding attention model built in embedding space is to highlight the importance of each embedding element by weighting them using self attention. The frame attention model built in temporal space aims to find which frames are significant for speaker recognition. To evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, we use the TIMIT dataset and test our approach in the condition of five kinds of noise and different signal-noise-ratios (SNRs). In comparison with three strong baselines, CNN, TDNN and TDNN+attention, the experimental results show that the use of our approach outperforms them in different conditions. The correct recognition rate obtained using our approach can still reach 49.1%, better than any baselines, even if the noise is Gaussian white Noise and the SNR is 0dB.\n",

      "        In this article, we study the classical shortest queue problem under the influence of malicious attacks, which is relevant to a variety of engineering system including transportation, manufacturing, and communications. We consider a homogeneous Poisson arrival process of jobs and two parallel exponential servers with symmetric service rates. A system operator route incoming jobs to the shorter queue; if the queues are equal, the job is routed randomly. A malicious attacker is able to intercept the operator's routing instruction and overwrite it with a randomly generated one. The operator is able to defend individual jobs to ensure correct routing. Both attacking and defending induce technological costs. The attacker's (resp. operator's) decision is the probability of attacking (resp. defending) the routing of each job. We first quantify the queuing cost for given strategy profiles by deriving a theoretical upper bound for the cost. Then, we formulate a non-zero-sum attacker-defender game, characterize the equilibria in multiple regimes, and quantify the security risk. We find that the attacker's best strategy is either to attack all jobs or not to attack, and the defender's strategy is strongly influenced by the arrival rate of jobs. Finally, as a benchmark, we compare the security risks of the feedback-controlled system to a corresponding open-loop system with Bernoulli routing. We show that the shorter-queue policy has a higher (resp. lower) security risk than the Bernoulli policy if the demand is lower (resp. higher) than the service rate of one server.\n",

These enablers promise an enhanced quality of life and professional efficiency; however, the synthesis of IoT and human augmentation technologies has also extended IoT-related challenges far beyond the current scope. These potential challenges associated with IoT-empowered Augmented Human (AH) have so far not been well-investigated. Thus, this article attempts to introduce readers to AH concept as well as summarize notable research challenges raised by such systems, in order to facilitate reader's further interest in this topic. The article considers emerging IoT applications for human augmentation, devices and design principles, connectivity demands, and security aspects.\n",

In our proof-of-concept low-fluence experiment the tomogram with Paganin-type phase-retrieval filter applied exhibited an effective net boost of $23\\pm 1$ in the signal-to-noise ratio as compared to an attenuation-based tomogram, implying an effective boost in neutron brilliance of well over two orders of magnitude. The phase-retrieval filter applies to monochromatic as well as poly-energetic neutron beams. Expressions are provided for the optimal phase-contrast geometry as well as conditions for the validity of the method. The underpinning theory is derived under the assumption of the sample being composed of a single material, but this can be generalized. The effective boost in brilliance may be employed to give reduced acquisition time, or may instead be used to keep exposure times fixed while improving contrast and spatial resolution.\n",

      "        Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including acetate, propionate and butyrate, are organic fatty-acids that are produced when indigested carbohydrates are fermented in the colon by gut-bacteria. Butyrate is especially considered a beneficial compound in relation to gut health and the maintenance of colonic homeostasis. Little is known about butyrate production and the current measurement methods of fecal samples are not representative and there is a strong unmet need to measure SCFAs in-vivo to further understand their role and effect on colonic function in human gut health and disease. The general aim of the project is to develop a novel sensor based on infrared technology that is capable of online detecting short chain fatty acids (SCFA; e.g. acetate, propionate and butyrate) and other small biomolecules (e.g. ammonium) produced in bioreactors. Whereas currently such levels of small biomolecules are usually not detected online due to practical constraints (sampling-analysis-processing of data), reliable online detection could significantly decrease analysis costs. Further, it would allow to perform online quality control of the bioreactors and allow to e.g. detect deviating values at an early stage. Hence, one can react much faster tackling certain problems which will further improve the quality of each experiment. Using machine learning algorithms to process the sensor signals, the results from testing in a so-called artificial gut setup are described in this technical report.\n",

Due to limitations of hardware technology (unavailability of data acquisition apparatus), experimental microwave imaging is very challenging for the pioneers. However, Probably due to the hardware cost, most of the studies (operating at a few GHz) were still focused on software only. The feasibility of using microwave approaches to image different types of objects have been tested and verified by simulations in a variety of applications. Further, work has been conducted on improving both quantitative and qualitative algorithms to improve simulated reconstruction results. Nowadays, benefitting from the hardware progress and reduction of their cost, researchers are eager to pursue real experimental validations instead of simulations, and, more unique prototypes and commercial systems have been built for various applications. These prototypes and systems are a result of years of dedicated work and it is important to review the advancements in developed prototype systems. The article will provide an overview of the many of the systems designed from different research groups throughout the world, for applications of near-field microwave imaging. The article further outlines challenges faced in current microwave near-field imaging, developmental tendencies of engineers and scientists, and the future outlook.\n",

Driven by a simple DC current, the devices generate flat broadband frequency combs, containing tens of equidistant optical tones with line spacings of tens of GHz. Here we show that QD-MLLDs can not only be used as multi-wavelength light sources at a WDM transmitter, but also as multi-wavelength local oscillators (LO) for parallel coherent reception. In our experiments, we demonstrate transmission of an aggregate data rate of 4.1 Tbit/s (23x45 GBd PDM-QPSK) over 75 km standard single-mode fiber (SSMF). To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first demonstration of a coherent WDM link that relies on QD-MLLD both at the transmitter and the receiver.\n",

      "        Deep learning approaches based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successful in solving a number of problems in medical imaging, including image segmentation. In recent years, it has been shown that CNNs are vulnerable to attacks in which the input image is perturbed by relatively small amounts of noise so that the CNN is no longer able to perform a segmentation of the perturbed image with sufficient accuracy. Therefore, exploring methods on how to attack CNN-based models as well as how to defend models against attacks have become a popular topic as this also provides insights into the performance and generalization abilities of CNNs. However, most of the existing work assumes unrealistic attack models, i.e. the resulting attacks were specified in advance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for generating adversarial examples to attack CNN-based segmentation models for medical images. Our approach has three key features: 1) The generated adversarial examples exhibit anatomical variations (in form of deformations) as well as appearance perturbations; 2) The adversarial examples attack segmentation models so that the Dice scores decrease by a pre-specified amount; 3) The attack is not required to be specified beforehand. We have evaluated our approach on CNN-based approaches for the multi-organ segmentation problem in 2D CT images. We show that the proposed approach can be used to attack different CNN-based segmentation models.\n",

      "        In this paper, we develop an energy efficient resource allocation scheme for orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) networks with in-band full-duplex (IBFD) communication between the base station and user equipments (UEs) considering a realistic self-interference (SI) model. Our primary aim is to maximize the system energy efficiency (EE) through a joint power control and sub-carrier assignment in both the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL), where the quality of service requirements of the UEs in DL and UL are guaranteed. The formulated problem is non-convex due to the non-linear fractional objective function and the non-convex feasible set which is generally intractable. In order to handle this difficulty, we first use fractional programming to transform the fractional objective function to the subtractive form. Then, by employing Dinkelbach method, we propose an iterative algorithm in which an inner problem is solved in each iteration. Applying majorization-minimization approximation, we make the inner problem convex. Also, by introducing a penalty function to handle integer sub-carrier assignment variables, we propose an iterative algorithm for addressing the inner problem. We show that our proposed algorithm converges to the locally optimal solution which is also demonstrated by our simulation results. In addition, simulation results show that by applying the IBFD capability in OFDMA networks with efficient SI cancellation techniques, our proposed resource allocation algorithm attains a 75% increase in the EE as compared to the half-duplex system.\n",

      "        Understanding the sleep quality and architecture is essential to human being's health, which is usually represented using multiple sleep stages. A standard sleep stage determination requires Electroencephalography (EEG) signals during the expensive and labor-intensive Polysomnography (PSG) test. To overcome this inconvenience, cardiorespiratory signals are proposed for the same purpose because of the easy and comfortable acquisition by simplified devices. In this paper, we leverage our low-cost wearable multi-sensor system to acquire the cardiorespiratory signals from subjects. Three novel features are designed during the feature extraction. We then apply a Bi-directional Recurrent Neural Network architecture with Long Short-term Memory (BLSTM) to predict the four-class sleep stages. Our prediction accuracy is 80.25% on a large public dataset (417 subjects), and 80.75% on our 32 enrolled subjects, respectively. Our results outperform the previous works which either used small data sets and had the potential over-fitting issues, or used the conventional machine learning methods on large data sets.\n",

      "        Semidefinite and sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization are fundamental computational tools in many areas, including linear and nonlinear systems theory. However, the scale of problems that can be addressed reliably and efficiently is still limited. In this paper, we introduce a new notion of \\emph{block factor-width-two matrices} and build a new hierarchy of inner and outer approximations of the cone of positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices. This notion is a block extension of the standard factor-width-two matrices, and allows for an improved inner-approximation of the PSD cone. In the context of SOS optimization, this leads to a block extension of the \\emph{scaled diagonally dominant sum-of-squares (SDSOS)} polynomials. By varying a matrix partition, the notion of block factor-width-two matrices can balance a trade-off between the computation scalability and solution quality for solving semidefinite and SOS optimization. Numerical experiments on large-scale instances confirm our theoretical findings.\n",

      "        Autonomous landing on a moving platform presents unique challenges for multirotor vehicles, including the need to accurately localize the platform, fast trajectory planning, and precise/robust control. Previous works studied this problem but most lack explicit consideration of the wind disturbance, which typically leads to slow descents onto the platform. This work presents a fully autonomous vision-based system that addresses these limitations by tightly coupling the localization, planning, and control, thereby enabling fast and accurate landing on a moving platform. The platform's position, orientation, and velocity are estimated by an extended Kalman filter using simulated GPS measurements when the quadrotor-platform distance is large, and by a visual fiducial system when the platform is nearby. The landing trajectory is computed online using receding horizon control and is followed by a boundary layer sliding controller that provides tracking performance guarantees in the presence of unknown, but bounded, disturbances. To improve the performance, the characteristics of the turbulent conditions are accounted for in the controller. The landing trajectory is fast, direct, and does not require hovering over the platform, as is typical of most state-of-the-art approaches. Simulations and hardware experiments are presented to validate the robustness of the approach.\n",

Motivated by the multi-reference alignment problem and generalizations thereof, we analyze the statistical properties of this representation given a large number of independent corruptions of a target signal. We prove the nonlinear wavelet based representation uniquely defines the power spectrum but allows for an unbiasing procedure that cannot be directly applied to the power spectrum. After unbiasing the representation to remove the effects of the additive noise and random dilations, we recover an approximation of the power spectrum by solving a convex optimization problem, and thus obtain the target signal up to an unknown phase. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the statistical robustness of this approximation procedure.\n",

      "        This paper considers the problem to plan mobile sensor networks for target localization task in GPS-denied environments. Most researches on mobile sensor networks assume that the states of the sensing agents are precisely known during their missions, which is not feasible under the absence of external infrastructures such as GPS. Thus, we propose a new algorithm to solve this problem by: (i) estimating the states of the sensing agents in addition to the target's through the combination of a particle filter (PF) and extended Kalman filters (EKF) and (ii) involving the uncertainty of the states of the sensing agents in planning the sensor networks based on the combined filters. This approach does not require any additional internal/external sensors nor the prior knowledge of the surrounding environments. We demonstrate the limitations of prior works in GPS-denied environments and the improvements from the proposed algorithm through Monte Carlo experiments.\n",

      "        Feedback dynamic routing is a commonly used control strategy in transportation systems. This class of control strategies relies on real-time information about the traffic state in each link. However, such information may not always be observable due to temporary sensing faults. In this article, we consider dynamic routing over two parallel routes, where the sensing on each link is subject to recurrent and random faults. The faults occur and clear according to a finite-state Markov chain. When the sensing is faulty on a link, the traffic state on that link appears to be zero to the controller. Building on the theories of Markov processes and monotone dynamical systems, we derive lower and upper bounds for the resilience score, i.e. the guaranteed throughput of the network, in the face of sensing faults by establishing stability conditions for the network. We use these results to study how a variety of key parameters affect the resilience score of the network. The main conclusions are: (i) Sensing faults can reduce throughput and destabilize a nominally stable network; (ii) A higher failure rate does not necessarily reduce throughput, and there may exist a worst rate that minimizes throughput; (iii) Higher correlation between the failure probabilities of two links leads to greater throughput; (iv) A large difference in capacity between two links can result in a drop in throughput.\n",

      "        While transmission expansions are planned to have positive impact on reliability of power grids, they could increase the risk and severity of some of the detrimental incidents in power grid mainly by virtue of changing system configuration, consequently electrical distance. This paper aims to evaluate and quantify the impact of transmission expansion projects on Sub-Synchronous Resonance (SSR) risk through a two-step approach utilizing outage count index and Sub-synchronous damping index. A graph-theory based SSR screening tool is introduced to quantify the outage count associated with all grid contingencies which results in radial connection between renewable generation resources and nearby series compensated lines. Moreover, a frequency-scan based damping analysis is performed to assess the impact of transmission expansion on the system damping in sub-synchronous frequency range. The proposed approach has been utilized to evaluate the impact of recently-built transmission expansion project on SSR risk in a portion of Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid.\n",

      "        In this paper, we propose efficient importance sampling estimators to evaluate the outage probability of maximum ratio combining receivers over turbulence-induced fadings in underwater wireless optical channels. We consider two fading models: exponential-lognormal, and exponential-generalized Gamma. The cross-entropy optimization method is used to determine the optimal biased distribution. We show by simulations that the number of samples required by importance sampling estimator is much less compared to naive Monte Carlo for the same accuracy requirement.\n",

This paper seeks for new, cheap, low complexity, deep learning based solution. Several new combinations of deep learning and conventional structures (in different parts such as constellation shaper, channel estimator, and detector) are presented investigated, and compared over all atmospheric turbulence regimes from weak to strong (considering Gamma-Gamma atmospheric turbulence model). Results indicate that deep learning could provide close enough performance to the perfect channel estimation scheme, and it is immune to the atmospheric turbulence variation. The proposed deep learning based solutions are low cost, low complexity, with favorable performance. Accordingly, they are recommended for channel estimation in mobile communication systems. Because these system should deliver favorable, and cheap services to the costumers, which use a small mobile as transceiver that needs to be cheap, low complexity and low power consuming.\n",

This paper presents a deep learning based structure for combating this issue. In order to show the effect of using deep learning, the symbol error rate of a simple free space optical (FSO) communication system is simulated over correlated and un-correlated log-normal channel with write/ wrong CSI. Novelties and contributions of this paper, which are done for the first in machine learning for FSO communication include considering deep learning, considering Log-normal channel, considering correlated channel, considering imperfect CSI. The proposed deep learning based structure is compared with maximum likelihood detector, it is shown that in perfect CSI, both perform the same (because maximum likelihood is optimum), but in imperfect CSI, proposed deep learning based structure outperforms maximum likelihood in channels with un-correlation or desired correlation lengths.\n",

It is well-known that this problem can be solved with convex programming within the Youla domain if and only if a condition known as Quadratic Invariance (QI) holds. In this paper, we first show that given QI sparsity constraints, one can directly descend the gradient of the cost function within the domain of output-feedback controllers and converge to a global optimum. Note that convergence is guaranteed despite non-convexity of the cost function. Second, we characterize a class of Uniquely Stationary (US) problems, for which first-order methods are guaranteed to converge to a global optimum. We show that the class of US problems is strictly larger than that of strongly QI problems and that it is not included in that of QI problems. We refer to Figure 1 for details. Finally, we propose a tractable test for the US property.\n",

We first address the problem of RGB-thermal camera calibration by proposing a passive calibration target and procedure that is both portable and easy to use. Second, we present PST900, a dataset of 894 synchronized and calibrated RGB and Thermal image pairs with per pixel human annotations across four distinct classes from the DARPA Subterranean Challenge. Lastly, we propose a CNN architecture for fast semantic segmentation that combines both RGB and Thermal imagery in a way that leverages RGB imagery independently.

      "        This paper presents results on the detection and identification mango fruits from colour images of trees. We evaluate the behaviour and the performances of the Faster R-CNN network to determine whether it is robust enough to \"detect and classify\" fruits under particularly heterogeneous conditions in terms of plant cultivars, plantation scheme, and visual information acquisition contexts. The network is trained to distinguish the 'Kent', 'Keitt', and \"Boucodiekhal\" mango cultivars from 3,000 representative labelled fruit annotations. The validation set composed of about 7,000 annotations was then tested with a confidence threshold of 0.7 and a Non-Maximal-Suppression threshold of 0.25. With a F1-score of 0.90, the Faster R-CNN is well suitable to the simple fruit detection in tiles of 500x500 pixels. We then combine a multi-tiling approach with a Jaccard matrix to merge the different parts of objects detected several times, and thus report the detections made at the tile scale to the native 6,000x4,000 pixel size images. Nonetheless with a F1-score of 0.56, the cultivar identification Faster R-CNN network presents some limitations for simultaneously detecting the mango fruits and identifying their respective cultivars. Despite the proven errors in fruit detection, the cultivar identification rates of the detected mango fruits are in the order of 80%. The ideal solution could combine a Mask R-CNN for the image pre-segmentation of trees and a double-stream Faster R-CNN for detecting the mango fruits and identifying their respective cultivar to provide predictions more relevant to users' expectations.\n",

      "        End-to-end Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) is proposed to infer the semantic meaning directly from audio features without intermediate text representation. Although the acoustic model component of an end-to-end SLU system can be pre-trained with Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) targets, the SLU component can only learn semantic features from limited task-specific training data. In this paper, for the first time we propose to do large-scale unsupervised pre-training for the SLU component of an end-to-end SLU system, so that the SLU component may preserve semantic features from massive unlabeled audio data. As the output of the acoustic model component, i.e. phoneme posterior sequences, has much different characteristic from text sequences, we propose a novel pre-training model called BERT-PLM, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers through Permutation Language Modeling. BERT-PLM trains the SLU component on unlabeled data through a regression objective equivalent to the partial permutation language modeling objective, while leverages full bi-directional context information with BERT networks. The experiment results show that our approach out-perform the state-of-the-art end-to-end systems with over 12.5% error reduction.\n",

The automatic methods that have been developed include the automatic localization of both closely- and distantly-spaced CI electrode arrays in post-implantation CTs and the automatic selection of electrode configurations based on the stimulation patterns. Together with the existing automatic techniques developed for IGCIP, the proposed automatic methods enable an end-to-end IGCIP process that takes pre- and post-implantation CT images as input and produces a patient-customized electrode configuration as output.\n",

      "        Recent advances in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology have revolutionized a broad class of civil and military applications. However, the designs of wireless technologies that enable real-time streaming of high-definition video between UAVs and ground clients present a conundrum. Most existing adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms are not optimized for the air-to-ground links, which usually fluctuate dramatically due to the dynamic flight states of the UAV. In this paper, we present SA-ABR, a new sensor-augmented system that generates ABR video streaming algorithms with the assistance of various kinds of inherent sensor data that are used to pilot UAVs. By incorporating the inherent sensor data with network observations, SA-ABR trains a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model to extract salient features from the flight state information and automatically learn an ABR algorithm to adapt to the varying UAV channel capacity through the training process. SA-ABR does not rely on any assumptions or models about UAV's flight states or the environment, but instead, it makes decisions by exploiting temporal properties of past throughput through the long short-term memory (LSTM) to adapt itself to a wide range of highly dynamic environments. We have implemented SA-ABR in a commercial UAV and evaluated it in the wild. We compare SA-ABR with a variety of existing state-of-the-art ABR algorithms, and the results show that our system outperforms the best known existing ABR algorithm by 21.4% in terms of the average quality of experience (QoE) reward.\n",

      "        Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) systems are considered as key potential enablers to improve driving safety and traffic efficiency. They allow for automated vehicle following using wireless communication in addition to onboard sensors. To achieve string stability in CACC platoons, constant time headway (CTH) spacing policies have prevailed in research; namely, vehicle interspacing grows with the speed. While constant distance headway (CDH) spacing policies provide superior potential to increase traffic capacity than CTH, a major drawback is a smaller safety margin at high velocities and string stability cannot be achieved using a one-vehicle look-ahead communication. The hypothesis of this work is to apply CDH only in few driving situations, when traffic throughput is of highest importance and safety requirements can be met due to comparably low velocities. As the most relevant situations where CDH could be applied, we identify starting platoons at signalized intersections. In this paper, we illustrate this idea. Specifically, we compare CTH with CDH regarding its potential to increase the capacity of traffic lights. Starting with the elementary situation of single traffic lights we expand our scope to whole traffic networks including several thousand vehicles in simulation. Using real world data to calibrate and validate vehicle dynamics simulation and traffic simulation, the study discusses the most relevant working parameters of CDH, CTH, and the traffic system in which both are applied.\n",

      "        In this paper, we consider coordinated movement of a network of vehicles consisting a bounded number of malicious agents, that is, vehicles must reach consensus in longitudinal position and a common predefined velocity. The motions of vehicles are modeled by double-integrator dynamics and communications over the network are asynchronous with delays. Each normal vehicle updates its states by utilizing the information it receives from vehicles in its vicinity. On the other hand, misbehaving vehicles make updates arbitrarily and might threaten the consensus within the network by intentionally changing their moving direction or broadcasting faulty information in their neighborhood. We propose an asynchronous updating strategy for normal vehicles, based on filtering extreme values received from neighboring vehicles, to save them from being misguided by malicious vehicles. We show that there exist topological constraints on the network in terms of graph robustness under which the vehicles resiliently achieve coordinated movement. Numerical simulations are provided to evaluate the results.\n",

Low-power wireless communication technology is preferred for its low cost, small form factor, and flexibility, especially if the devices support multi-hop communication. Thus far, however, feedback control over multi-hop low-power wireless networks has only been demonstrated for update intervals on the order of seconds. To fill this gap, this paper presents a wireless embedded system that supports dynamic mode changes and tames imperfections impairing control performance (e.g., jitter and message loss), and a control design that exploits the essential properties of this system to provably guarantee closed-loop stability for physical processes with linear time-invariant dynamics in the presence of mode changes. Using experiments on a cyber-physical testbed with 20 wireless devices and multiple cart-pole systems, we are the first to demonstrate and evaluate feedback control and coordination with mode changes over multi-hop networks for update intervals of 20 to 50 milliseconds.\n",

      "        Objective: Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by the occurrence of spontaneous seizures, which affects about one percent of the world's population. Most of the current seizure detection approaches strongly rely on patient history records and thus fail in the patient-independent situation of detecting the new patients. To overcome such limitation, we propose a robust and explainable epileptic seizure detection model that effectively learns from seizure states while eliminates the inter-patient noises. Methods: A complex deep neural network model is proposed to learn the pure seizure-specific representation from the raw non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals through adversarial training. Furthermore, to enhance the explainability, we develop an attention mechanism to automatically learn the importance of each EEG channels in the seizure diagnosis procedure. Results: The proposed approach is evaluated over the Temple University Hospital EEG (TUH EEG) database. The experimental results illustrate that our model outperforms the competitive state-of-the-art baselines with low latency. Moreover, the designed attention mechanism is demonstrated ables to provide fine-grained information for pathological analysis. Conclusion and significance: We propose an effective and efficient patient-independent diagnosis approach of epileptic seizure based on raw EEG signals without manually feature engineering, which is a step toward the development of large-scale deployment for real-life use.\n",

      "        Employing pre-trained language models (LM) to extract contextualized word representations has achieved state-of-the-art performance on various NLP tasks. However, applying this technique to noisy transcripts generated by automatic speech recognizer (ASR) is concerned. Therefore, this paper focuses on making contextualized representations more ASR-robust. We propose a novel confusion-aware fine-tuning method to mitigate the impact of ASR errors to pre-trained LMs. Specifically, we fine-tune LMs to produce similar representations for acoustically confusable words that are obtained from word confusion networks (WCNs) produced by ASR. Experiments on the benchmark ATIS dataset show that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of spoken language understanding when performing on ASR transcripts.\n",

Nevertheless, the proposed IFR-CS still has some limitations, such as the selection of hyper-parameters, a lengthy reconstruction time, and the fixed sparsifying transform. To alleviate these issues, we unroll the iterative feature refinement procedures in IFR-CS to a supervised model-driven network, dubbed IFR-Net. Equipped with training data pairs, both regularization parameter and the utmost feature refinement operator in IFR-CS become trainable. Additionally, inspired by the powerful representation capability of convolutional neural network (CNN), CNN-based inversion blocks are explored in the sparsity-promoting denoising module to generalize the sparsity-enforcing operator. Extensive experiments on both simulated and in vivo MR datasets have shown that the proposed network possesses a strong capability to capture image details and preserve well the structural information with fast reconstruction speed.\n",

      "        Direct training based spiking neural networks (SNNs) have been paid a lot of attention recently because of its high energy efficiency on emerging neuromorphic hardware. However, due to the non-differentiability of the spiking activity, most of the related SNNs still cannot achieve high object recognition accuracy for the complicated dataset, such as CIFAR-10. Even though some of them can reach the accuracy of 90%, the energy consumption in those networks is very high. Considering this, we propose a direct supervised learning based spiking convolutional neural networks (SCNNs) using temporal coding scheme in this study, aiming to exploit minimum trainable parameters to recognize the object in the image with high accuracy. The MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed networks. For the MNIST dataset, the proposed networks with noise input are able to reach the high recognition accuracy (99.13%) as the other state-of-art models but use the much less trainable parameters than them. For CIFAR-10 dataset, the proposed networks with data augmentation step can reach the recognition accuracy of 80.49%., which is the state-of-art high accuracy in the field of direct training based SNNs using temporal coding manner. In addition, the number of trainable parameters used in such networks is much less than that in the conversion based SCNNs reported in the literature.\n",

      "        This paper describes a new type of image classifier that uses a shallow architecture with a very quick learning phase. The image is parsed into smaller areas and each area is saved directly for a region, along with the related output category. When a new image is presented, a direct match with each part is made and the best matching areas returned. These areas can overlap with each other and when moving from a region to its neighbours, there is likely to be only small changes in the area image part. It would therefore be possible to guess what the best image part is for one region by cumulating the results of its neighbours. This is in fact an associative feature of the classifier that can re-construct missing or noisy input by substituting the direct match with what the region match suggests and is being called 'Region Creep'. As each area stores the categories it belongs to, the image classification process sums this to return a preferred category for the whole image. The classifier works mostly at a local level and so to give it some type of global picture, rules are added. These rules work at the whole image level and basically state that if one set of pixels are present, another set should be removed or should also be present. While the rules appear to be very specific, most of the construction can be done automatically. Tests on a set of hand-written numbers have produced state-of-the-art results.\n",

      "        Objective: A median of 14.4% of patient undergone at least one adverse event during surgery and a third of them are preventable. The occurrence of adverse events forces surgeons to implement corrective strategies and, thus, deviate from the standard surgical process. Therefore, it is clear that the automatic identification of adverse events is a major challenge for patient safety. In this paper, we have proposed a method enabling us to identify such deviations. We have focused on identifying surgeons' deviations from standard surgical processes due to surgical events rather than anatomic specificities. This is particularly challenging, given the high variability in typical surgical procedure workflows. Methods: We have introduced a new approach designed to automatically detect and distinguish surgical process deviations based on multi-dimensional non-linear temporal scaling with a hidden semi-Markov model using manual annotation of surgical processes. The approach was then evaluated using cross-validation. Results: The best results have over 90% accuracy. Recall and precision were superior at 70%. We have provided a detailed analysis of the incorrectly-detected observations. Conclusion: Multi-dimensional non-linear temporal scaling with a hidden semi-Markov model provides promising results for detecting deviations. Our error analysis of the incorrectly-detected observations offers different leads in order to further improve our method. Significance: Our method demonstrated the feasibility of automatically detecting surgical deviations that could be implemented for both skill analysis and developing situation awareness-based computer-assisted surgical systems.\n",

      "        Deep learning (DL) architectures for superresolution (SR) normally contain tremendous parameters, which has been regarded as the crucial advantage for obtaining satisfying performance. However, with the widespread use of mobile phones for taking and retouching photos, this character greatly hampers the deployment of DL-SR models on the mobile devices. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a super lightweight SR network: s-LWSR. There are mainly three contributions in our work. Firstly, in order to efficiently abstract features from the low resolution image, we build an information pool to mix multi-level information from the first half part of the pipeline. Accordingly, the information pool feeds the second half part with the combination of hierarchical features from the previous layers. Secondly, we employ a compression module to further decrease the size of parameters. Intensive analysis confirms its capacity of trade-off between model complexity and accuracy. Thirdly, by revealing the specific role of activation in deep models, we remove several activation layers in our SR model to retain more information for performance improvement. Extensive experiments show that our s-LWSR, with limited parameters and operations, can achieve similar performance to other cumbersome DL-SR methods.\n",

      "        We consider computation offloading for Internet-of-things (IoT) applications in multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) cloud-radio-access-network (C-RAN). Due to the limited battery life and computational capability in the IoT devices (IoTDs), the computational tasks of the IoTDs are offloaded to a MIMO C-RAN, where a MIMO radio resource head (RRH) is connected to a baseband unit (BBU) through a capacity-limited fronthaul link, facilitated by the spatial filtering and uniform scalar quantization. We formulate a computation offloading optimization problem to minimize the total transmit power of the IoTDs while satisfying the latency requirement of the computational tasks, and find that the problem is non-convex. To obtain a feasible solution, firstly the spatial filtering matrix is locally optimized at the MIMO RRH. Subsequently, we leverage the alternating optimization framework for joint optimization on the residual variables at the BBU, where the baseband combiner is obtained in a closed-form, the resource allocation sub-problem is solved through successive inner convexification, and the number of quantization bits is obtained by a line-search method. As a low-complexity approach, we deploy a supervised deep learning method, which is trained with the solutions to our optimization algorithm. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the deep learning method.\n",

Existing studies typically make use of on-body solutions such as inertial and audio sensors, while video is used as ground truth. Intake gesture detection directly based on video has rarely been attempted. In this study, we address this gap and show that deep learning architectures can successfully be applied to the problem of video-based detection of intake gestures. For this purpose, we collect and label video data of eating occasions using 360-degree video of 102 participants. Applying state-of-the-art approaches from video action recognition, our results show that (1) the best model achieves an $F_1$ score of 0.858, (2) appearance features contribute more than motion features, and (3) temporal context in form of multiple video frames is essential for top model performance.\n",

      "        The video super-resolution (VSR) task aims to restore a high-resolution (HR) video frame by using its corresponding low-resolution (LR) frame and multiple neighboring frames. At present, many deep learning-based VSR methods rely on optical flow to perform frame alignment. The final recovery results will be greatly affected by the accuracy of optical flow. However, optical flow estimation cannot be completely accurate, and there are always some errors. In this paper, we propose a novel deformable non-local network (DNLN) which is a non-optical-flow-based method. Specifically, we apply the deformable convolution and improve its ability of adaptive alignment at the feature level. Furthermore, we utilize a non-local structure to capture the global correlation between the reference frame and the aligned neighboring frames, and simultaneously enhance desired fine details in the aligned frames. To reconstruct the final high-quality HR video frames, we use residual in residual dense blocks to take full advantage of the hierarchical features. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed DNLN can achieve state-of-the-art performance on VSR task.\n",

      "        Phase retrieval (PR) is an inverse problem about recovering a signal from phaseless linear measurements. This problem can be effectively solved by minimizing a nonconvex amplitude-based loss function. However, this loss function is non-smooth. To address the non-smoothness, a series of methods have been proposed by adding truncating, reweighting and smoothing operations to adjust the gradient or the loss function and achieved better performance. But these operations bring about extra rules and parameters that need to be carefully designed. Unlike previous works, we present a smooth amplitude flow method (SAF) which minimizes a novel loss function, without additionally modifying the gradient or the loss function during gradient descending. Such a new heuristic can be regarded as a smooth version of the original non-smooth amplitude-based loss function. We prove that SAF can converge geometrically to a global optimal point via the gradient algorithm with an elaborate initialization stage with a high probability. Substantial numerical tests empirically illustrate that the proposed heuristic is significantly superior to the original amplitude-based loss function and SAF also outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of the recovery rate and the converging speed. Specially, it is numerically shown that SAF can stably recover the original signal when number of measurements is smaller than the information-theoretic limit for both the real and the complex Gaussian models.\n",

      "        This paper presents a methodology and workflow that overcome the limitations of the conventional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for geological facies modeling. It attempts to improve the training stability and guarantee the diversity of the generated geology through interpretable latent vectors. The resulting samples are ensured to have the equal probability (or an unbiased distribution) as from the training dataset. This is critical when applying GANs to generate unbiased and representative geological models that can be further used to facilitate objective uncertainty evaluation and optimal decision-making in oil field exploration and development.\n",
      "  We proposed and implemented a new variant of GANs called Info-WGAN for the geological facies modeling that combines Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Network (InfoGAN) with Wasserstein distance and Gradient Penalty (GP) for learning interpretable latent codes as well as generating stable and unbiased distribution from the training data. Different from the original GAN design, InfoGAN can use the training images with full, partial, or no labels to perform disentanglement of the complex sedimentary types exhibited in the training dataset to achieve the variety and diversity of the generated samples. This is accomplished by adding additional categorical variables that provide disentangled semantic representations besides the mere randomized latent vector used in the original GANs. By such means, a regularization term is used to maximize the mutual information between such latent categorical codes and the generated geological facies in the loss function.\n",
      "  Furthermore, the resulting unbiased sampling by Info-WGAN makes the data conditioning much easier than the conventional GANs in geological modeling because of the variety and diversity as well as the equal probability of the unconditional sampling by the generator.\n",

Methods: SMS excitations are combined with a single-shot IR radial FLASH sequence for data acquisition. A previously developed single-slice calibrationless model-based reconstruction is extended to SMS, formulating the estimation of parameter maps and coil sensitivities from all slices as a single nonlinear inverse problem. Joint-sparsity constraints are further applied to the parameter maps to improve T1 precision. Validations of the proposed method are performed for a phantom and for the human brain and liver in six healthy adult subjects. Results: Phantom results confirm good T1 accuracy and precision of the simultaneously acquired multi-slice T1 maps in comparison to single-slice references. In-vivo human brain studies demonstrate the better performance of SMS acquisitions compared to the conventional spoke-interleaved multi-slice acquisition using model-based reconstruction. Apart from good accuracy and precision, the results of six healthy subjects in both brain and abdominal studies confirm good reproducibility between scan and re-scans. The proposed method can simultaneously acquire T1 maps for five slices of a human brain ($0.75 \\times 0.75 \\times 5$ mm$^3$) or three slices of the abdomen ($1.25 \\times 1.25 \\times 6$ mm$^3$) within four seconds.\n",

However, self-measuring of power consumption at reasonable cost and complexity is unavailable as a generic system service. In this paper, we present Eco, a hardware-software co-design enabling generic energy management on IoT nodes. Eco is tailored to devices with limited resources and thus targets most of the upcoming IoT scenarios. The proposed measurement module combines commodity components with a common system interfaces to achieve easy, flexible integration with various hardware platforms and the RIOT IoT operating system. We thoroughly evaluate and compare accuracy and overhead. Our findings indicate that our commodity design competes well with highly optimized solutions, while being significantly more versatile. We employ Eco for energy management on RIOT and validate its readiness for deployment in a five-week field trial integrated with energy harvesting.\n",

      "        This paper proposes an accurate High Impedance Fault (HIF) detection and isolation scheme in a power distribution network. The proposed schemes utilize the data available from voltage and current sensors. The technique employs multiple algorithms consisting of Principal Component Analysis, Fisher Discriminant Analysis, Binary and Multiclass Support Vector Machine for detection and identification of the high impedance fault. These data driven techniques have been tested on IEEE 13-node distribution network for detection and identification of high impedance faults with broken and unbroken conductor. Further, the robustness of machine learning techniques has also been analysed by examining their performance with variation in loads for different faults. Simulation results for different faults at various locations have shown that proposed methods are fast and accurate in diagnosing high impedance faults. Multiclass Support Vector Machine gives the best result to detect and locate High Impedance Fault accurately. It ensures reliability, security and dependability of the distribution network.\n",

We propose general Gaussian Processes as a non-parametric model for correlated measurement noise that is flexible enough to accurately reflect correlation in time, yet simple enough to enable efficient computation. We show that this model accurately reflects the measurement noise resulting from vision-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), and argue that it provides a flexible means of modeling measurement noise for a wide variety of sensor systems and perception algorithms. We then extend existing results for Kalman filtering with autoregressive processes to more general Gaussian Processes, and demonstrate the improved performance of our approach.\n",

We used a fitting neural network as a simple tool for modelling the car's engine and control laws needed to calculate the suitable control commands passed to the brakes and gas pedals' actuators. Independent model method and constraints handling are used to provide controller robustness. We used MATLAB Simulink and IPG CarMaker to design and test our PFC controller. The performance of designed PFC controller is compared to the performance of a PI controller which exists within IPG CarMaker simulator.

      "        Methods based on Riemannian geometry have proven themselves to be good models for decoding in brain-computer interfacing (BCI). However, one major drawback of these methods is that it is not possible to determine what aspect of the signal the classifier is built on, leaving open the possibility that artifacts drive classification performance. In areas where artifactual control is problematic, specifically neurofeedback and BCIs in patient populations, this has led people to continue to rely on spatial filters as a way of generating features that are provably brain-related. Furthermore, these methods also suffer from the curse of dimensionality and are almost infeasible in high-density online BCI systems. To tackle these drawbacks, we introduce here a method for computing spatial filters from any linear function in the Riemannian tangent space, which allows for more efficient classification as well as the removal of artifact sources from classifiers built on Riemannian methods. We first prove a fundamental relationship between certain tangent spaces and spatial filtering methods, including an explanation of common spatial patterns within this framework, and then validate our proposed approach using an open-access BCI analysis framework.\n",

      "        This paper presents the formulation and analysis of a two time-scale optimization algorithm for multi-agent coordination for the purpose of distributed beamforming. Each agent is assumed to be randomly positioned with respect to each other with random phase offsets and amplitudes. Agents are tasked with coordinate among themselves to position themselves and adjust their phase offset and amplitude such that they can construct a desired directed beam. Here we propose a two time-scale optimization algorithm that consists of a fast time-scale algorithm to solve for the amplitude and phase while a slow time-scale algorithm to solve for the control required to re-position the agents. The numerical results given here indicate that the proposed two time-scale approach is able to reconstruct a desired beam pattern.\n",

      "        High-frequency ultrasound (HFU) is well suited for imaging embryonic mice in vivo because it is non-invasive and real-time. Manual segmentation of the brain ventricles (BVs) and whole body from 3D HFU images is time-consuming and requires specialized training. This paper presents a deep-learning-based segmentation pipeline which automates several time-consuming, repetitive tasks currently performed to study genetic mutations in developing mouse embryos. Namely, the pipeline accurately segments the BV and body regions in 3D HFU images of mouse embryos, despite significant challenges due to position and shape variation of the embryos, as well as imaging artifacts. Based on the BV segmentation, a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) is further trained to detect embryos with the Engrailed-1 (En1) mutation. The algorithms achieve 0.896 and 0.925 Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) for BV and body segmentation, respectively, and 95.8% accuracy on mutant classification. Through gradient based interrogation and visualization of the trained classifier, it is demonstrated that the model focuses on the morphological structures known to be affected by the En1 mutation.\n",

      "        This paper describes an approach for attractor selection in nonlinear dynamical systems with constrained actuation. Attractor selection is achieved using two different deep reinforcement learning methods: 1) the cross-entropy method (CEM) and 2) the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method. The framework and algorithms for applying these control methods are presented. Experiments were performed on a Duffing oscillator as it is a classic nonlinear dynamical system with multiple attractors. Both methods achieve attractor selection under various control constraints. While these methods have nearly identical success rates, the DDPG method has the advantages a high learning rate, low performance variance, and offers a smooth control approach. This experiment demonstrates the applicability of reinforcement learning to constrained attractor selection problems.\n",

      "        Assembly planning is a difficult problem for companies. Many disciplines such as design, planning, scheduling, and manufacturing execution need to be carefully engineered and coordinated to create successful product assembly plans. Recent research in the field of design for assembly has proposed new methodologies to design product structures in such a way that their assembly is easier. However, present assembly planning approaches lack the engineering tool support to capture all the constraints associated to assembly planning in a unified manner. This paper proposes CompositionalPlanning, a string diagram based framework for assembly planning. In the proposed framework, string diagrams and their compositional properties serve as the foundation for an engineering tool where CAD designs interact with planning and scheduling algorithms to automatically create high-quality assembly plans. These assembly plans are then executed in simulation to measure their performance and to visualize their key build characteristics. We demonstrate the versatility of this approach in the LEGO assembly domain. We developed two reference LEGO CAD models that are processed by CompositionalPlanning's algorithmic pipeline. We compare sequential and parallel assembly plans in a Minecraft simulation and show that the time-to-build performance can be optimized by our algorithms.\n",

      "        Terahertz (THz)-band communications are celebrated as a key enabling technology for next-generation wireless systems that promises to integrate a wide range of data-demanding and delay-sensitive applications. Following recent advancements in optical, electronic, and plasmonic transceiver design, integrated, adaptive, and efficient THz systems are no longer far-fetched. In this paper, we present a progressive vision of how the traditional \"THz gap\" will transform into a \"THz rush\" over the next few years. We posit that the breakthrough that the THz band will introduce will not be solely driven by achievable high data rates, but more profoundly by the interaction between THz sensing, imaging, and localization applications. We first detail the peculiarities of each of these applications at the THz band. Then, we illustrate how their coalescence results in enhanced environment-aware system performance in beyond-5G use cases. We further discuss the implementation aspects of this merging of applications in the context of shared and dedicated resource allocation, highlighting the role of machine learning.\n",

      "        The Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem is a fundamental building block for the optimization of electrical power systems. It is nonlinear and nonconvex and computes the generator setpoints for power and voltage, given a set of load demands. It is often needed to be solved repeatedly under various conditions, either in real-time or in large-scale studies. This need is further exacerbated by the increasing stochasticity of power systems due to renewable energy sources in front and behind the meter. To address these challenges, this paper presents a deep learning approach to the OPF. The learning model exploits the information available in the prior states of the system (which is commonly available in practical applications), as well as a dual Lagrangian method to satisfy the physical and engineering constraints present in the OPF. The proposed model is evaluated on a large collection of realistic power systems. The experimental results show that its predictions are highly accurate with average errors as low as 0.2%. Additionally, the proposed approach is shown to improve the accuracy of widely adopted OPF linear DC approximation by at least two orders of magnitude.\n",

      "        Computer-aided surgical systems commonly use preoperative CT scans when performing pelvic osteotomies for intraoperative navigation. These systems have the potential to improve the safety and accuracy of pelvic osteotomies, however, exposing the patient to radiation is a significant drawback. In order to reduce radiation exposure, we propose a new smooth extrapolation method leveraging a partial pelvis CT and a statistical shape model (SSM) of the full pelvis in order to estimate a patient's complete pelvis. A SSM of normal, complete, female pelvis anatomy was created and evaluated from 42 subjects. A leave-one-out test was performed to characterise the inherent generalisation capability of the SSM. An additional leave-one-out test was conducted to measure performance of the smooth extrapolation method and an existing \"cut-and-paste\" extrapolation method. Unknown anatomy was simulated by keeping the axial slices of the patient's acetabulum intact and varying the amount of the superior iliac crest retained; from 0% to 15% of the total pelvis extent. The smooth technique showed an average improvement over the cut-and-paste method of 1.31 mm and 3.61 mm, in RMS and maximum surface error, respectively. With 5% of the iliac crest retained, the smoothly estimated surface had an RMS surface error of 2.21 mm, an improvement of 1.25 mm when retaining none of the iliac crest. This anatomical estimation method creates the possibility of a patient and surgeon benefiting from the use of a CAS system and simultaneously reducing the patient's radiation exposure.\n",

      "        Periacetabular osteotomy is a challenging surgical procedure for treating developmental hip dysplasia, providing greater coverage of the femoral head via relocation of a patient's acetabulum. Since fluoroscopic imaging is frequently used in the surgical workflow, computer-assisted X-Ray navigation of osteotomes and the relocated acetabular fragment should be feasible. We use intensity-based 2D/3D registration to estimate the pelvis pose with respect to fluoroscopic images, recover relative poses of multiple views, and triangulate landmarks which may be used for navigation. Existing similarity metrics are unable to consistently account for the inherent mismatch between the preoperative intact pelvis, and the intraoperative reality of a fractured pelvis. To mitigate the effect of this mismatch, we continuously estimate the relevance of each pixel to solving the registration and use these values as weightings in a patch-based similarity metric. Limiting computation to randomly selected subsets of patches results in faster runtimes than existing patch-based methods. A simulation study was conducted with random fragment shapes, relocations, and fluoroscopic views, and the proposed method achieved a 1.7 mm mean triangulation error over all landmarks, compared to mean errors of 3 mm and 2.8 mm for the non-patched and image-intensity-variance-weighted patch similarity metrics, respectively.\n",

      "        Noisy situations cause huge problems for suffers of hearing loss as hearing aids often make the signal more audible but do not always restore the intelligibility. In noisy settings, humans routinely exploit the audio-visual (AV) nature of the speech to selectively suppress the background noise and to focus on the target speaker. In this paper, we present a causal, language, noise and speaker independent AV deep neural network (DNN) architecture for speech enhancement (SE). The model exploits the noisy acoustic cues and noise robust visual cues to focus on the desired speaker and improve the speech intelligibility. To evaluate the proposed SE framework a first of its kind AV binaural speech corpus, called ASPIRE, is recorded in real noisy environments including cafeteria and restaurant. We demonstrate superior performance of our approach in terms of objective measures and subjective listening tests over the state-of-the-art SE approaches as well as recent DNN based SE models. In addition, our work challenges a popular belief that a scarcity of multi-language large vocabulary AV corpus and wide variety of noises is a major bottleneck to build a robust language, speaker and noise independent SE systems. We show that a model trained on synthetic mixture of Grid corpus (with 33 speakers and a small English vocabulary) and ChiME 3 Noises (consisting of only bus, pedestrian, cafeteria, and street noises) generalise well not only on large vocabulary corpora but also on completely unrelated languages (such as Mandarin), wide variety of speakers and noises.\n",

      "        Conventional SSHI (synchronized switch harvesting on inductor) has been believed to be one of the most efficient interface circuits for piezoelectric vibration energy harvesting systems. It employs an inductor and the resulting RLC loop to synchronously invert the charge across the piezoelectric material to avoid charge and energy loss due to charging its internal capacitor ($C_P$). The performance of the SSHI circuit greatly depends on the inductor and a large inductor is often needed; hence significantly increases the volume of the system. An efficient interface circuit using a synchronous charge inversion technique, named as SSHC, was proposed recently. The SSHC rectifier utilizes capacitors, instead of inductors, to flip the voltage across the harvester. For a one-stage SSHC rectifier, one single intermediate capacitor ($C_T$) is employed to temporarily store charge flowed from $C_P$ and inversely charge $C_P$ to perform the charge inversion. In previous studies, the voltage flip efficiency achieves 1/3 when $C_T = C_P$. This paper presents that the voltage flip efficiency can be further increased to approach 1/2 if $C_T$ is chosen to be much larger than $C_P$.\n",

      "        Biomedical imaging is unequivocally dependent on the ability to reconstruct interpretable and high-quality images from acquired sensor data. This reconstruction process is pivotal across many applications, spanning from magnetic resonance imaging to ultrasound imaging. While advanced data-adaptive reconstruction methods can recover much higher image quality than traditional approaches, their implementation often poses a high computational burden. In ultrasound imaging, this burden is significant, especially when striving for low-cost systems, and has motivated the development of high-resolution and high-contrast adaptive beamforming methods. Here we show that deep neural networks that adopt the algorithmic structure and constraints of adaptive signal processing techniques can efficiently learn to perform fast high-quality ultrasound beamforming using very little training data. We apply our technique to two distinct ultrasound acquisition strategies (plane wave, and synthetic aperture), and demonstrate that high image quality can be maintained when measuring at low data-rates, using undersampled array designs. Beyond biomedical imaging, we expect that the proposed deep~learning based adaptive processing framework can benefit a variety of array and signal processing applications, in particular when data-efficiency and robustness are of importance.\n",

Inspired by generative adversarial networks, we present a generic end-to-end adversarial approach, which can be combined with a wide range of existing semantic segmentation networks to improve their segmentation performance. The key element of our method is to replace the commonly used binary adversarial loss with a high resolution pixel-wise loss. In addition, we train our generator employing stochastic weight averaging fashion, which further enhances the predicted output label maps leading to state-of-the-art results. We show, that this combination of pixel-wise adversarial training and weight averaging leads to significant and consistent gains in segmentation performance, compared to the baseline models.\n",

This thesis proposes deep learning architectures to improve automatic object localization and boundary delineation for salient object segmentation in natural images and for 2D medical image segmentation. First, we propose and evaluate a novel dilated dense encoder-decoder architecture with a custom dilated spatial pyramid pooling block to accurately localize and delineate boundaries for salient object segmentation. The dilation offers better spatial understanding and the dense connectivity preserves features learned at shallower levels of the network for better localization. Tested on three publicly available datasets, our architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art for one and is very competitive on the other two. Second, we propose and evaluate a custom 2D dilated dense UNet architecture for accurate lesion localization and segmentation in medical images. This architecture can be utilized as a stand-alone segmentation framework or used as a rich feature extracting backbone to aid other models in medical image segmentation. Our architecture outperforms all baseline models for accurate lesion localization and segmentation on a new dataset. We furthermore explore the main considerations that should be taken into account for 3D medical image segmentation, among them preprocessing techniques and specialized loss functions.\n",

Recently, it has been shown how compression errors can be compensated for in the optimization algorithm to improve the solution accuracy. Even though convergence guarantees for error-compensated algorithms have been established, there is very limited theoretical support for quantifying the observed improvements in solution accuracy. In this paper, we show that Hessian-aided error compensation, unlike other existing schemes, avoids the accumulation of compression errors on quadratic problems. We also present strong convergence guarantees of Hessian-based error compensation for stochastic gradient descent. Our numerical experiments highlight the benefits of Hessian-based error compensation, and demonstrate that similar convergence improvements are attained when only a diagonal Hessian approximation is used.\n",

      "        Modern sequence to sequence neural TTS systems provide close to natural speech quality. Such systems usually comprise a network converting linguistic/phonetic features sequence to an acoustic features sequence, cascaded with a neural vocoder. The generated speech prosody (i.e. phoneme durations, pitch and loudness) is implicitly present in the acoustic features, being mixed with spectral information. Although the speech sounds natural, its prosody realization is randomly chosen and cannot be easily altered. The prosody control becomes an even more difficult task if no prosodic labeling is present in the training data. Recently, much progress has been achieved in unsupervised speaking style learning and generation, however human inspection is still required after the training for discovery and interpretation of the speaking styles learned by the system. In this work we introduce a fully automatic method that makes the system aware of the prosody and enables sentence-wise speaking pace and expressiveness control on a continuous scale. While being useful by itself in many applications, the proposed prosody control can also improve the overall quality and expressiveness of the synthesized speech, as demonstrated by subjective listening evaluations. We also propose a novel augmented attention mechanism, that facilitates better pace control sensitivity and faster attention convergence.\n",

      "        The first of this two-paper series proposes and elaborates a concept of electric vehicle (EV)-based e-mobility system. To this end, models designed to reap the benefits of EVs' flexibility in the literature almost exclusively consider charging stations as active players exploiting the EVs' flexibility. Such stations are seen as static loads able to provide flexibility only when EVs are connected to them. However, this standpoint suffers from two major issues. First, the charging stations need to anticipate some important parameters of the incoming EVs, e.g. time of arrival and departure, state-of-energy of the EV's battery at arrival and the required state-of-energy at its departure. Second, it observes the EVs only when they are connected to these charging stations, thus overlooking the arbitrage and charging opportunities when the EVs are connected to other charging stations. This paper proposes a new viewpoint, where EVs are observed as dynamic movable storage systems which can provide flexibility at any charging station. The paper defines both systems, the existing one, where the flexibility is viewed from the standpoint of charging stations, and the proposed one, where the flexibility is viewed from the EVs' standpoint.\n",

      "        Within the context of biomass production this paper proposes a method for logistics optimisation involving multiple tours to be executed simultaneously by groups of harvesting units (HUs) and support units (SUs) to first harvest biomass from multiple agricultural fields, before supplying the biomass to multiple biogas plants (BPs) via shuttling SUs. This problem is relevant on a larger scale in particular for contractors. This problem is complex since there are three interconnected optimisation levels: (i) the assignment of BPs to tours and the ordering of BPs assigned to each tour, (ii) the assignment of fields to BPs and the ordering of fields assigned to each BP, and (iii) determining the number of HUs and SUs assigned to each tour, whereby different HUs and SUs may in general have different working rates and loading capacities. The dimensions of the problem considered in this paper are inspired by a large real-world scenario with 7 tours, 20 biogas plants, 1200 corn fields, 7 HUs and a total of 42 SUs operated on an area of 80km$\\times$80km. Both problem modeling and a solution method are discussed. For the latter a GPU-accelerated heuristic search algorithm is proposed. For the former an optimisation criterion minimising both total accumulated path length and the maximum completion time over all harvesters tours, an embedded local minimisation for the assignment of SUs to tours, and demand fulfilment constraints for BPs are discussed. In stochastic simulation experiments it is found that permitting unconstrained assignment of any available field that a contractor services to any available BP independent of their ownerships is crucial to attain maximum path length savings and also to best balance and minimise uniform completion times over all harvesters tours such that weather-dependent harvesting windows can be exploited optimally.\n",

      "        The general context of this work is the feedback control of an infinite-dimensional system so that the closed-loop system satisfies a fading-memory property and achieves the setpoint tracking of a given reference signal. More specifically, this paper is concerned with the Proportional Integral (PI) regulation control of the left Neumann trace of a one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation with a delayed right Dirichlet boundary control. In this setting, the studied reaction-diffusion equation might be either open-loop stable or unstable. The proposed control strategy goes as follows. First, a finite-dimensional truncated model that captures the unstable dynamics of the original infinite-dimensional system is obtained via spectral decomposition. The truncated model is then augmented by an integral component on the tracking error of the left Neumann trace. After resorting to the Artstein transformation to handle the control input delay, the PI controller is designed by pole shifting. Stability of the resulting closed-loop infinite-dimensional system, consisting of the original reaction-diffusion equation with the PI controller, is then established thanks to an adequate Lyapunov function. In the case of a time-varying reference input and a time-varying distributed disturbance, our stability result takes the form of an exponential Input-to-State Stability (ISS) estimate with fading memory. Finally, another exponential ISS estimate with fading memory is established for the tracking performance of the reference signal by the system output. In particular, these results assess the setpoint regulation of the left Neumann trace in the presence of distributed perturbations that converge to a steady-state value and with a time-derivative that converges to zero. Numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate the efficiency of our control strategy.\n",

      "        For beamforming ultrasound (US) signals, typically a spatially constant speed-of-sound (SoS) is assumed to calculate delays. As SoS in tissue may vary relatively largely, this approximation may cause wavefront aberrations, thus degrading effective imaging resolution. In the literature, corrections have been proposed based on unidirectional SoS estimation or computationally-expensive a posteriori phase rectification. In this paper we demonstrate a direct delay correction approach for US beamforming, by leveraging 2D spatial SoS distribution estimates from plane-wave imaging. We show both in simulations and with ex vivo measurements that resolutions close to the wavelength limit can be achieved using our proposed local SoS-adaptive beamforming, yielding a lateral resolution improvement of 22% to 29% on tissue samples with up to 3% SoS-contrast (45m/s). We verify that our method accurately images absolute positions of tissue structures down to sub-pixel resolution of a tenth of a wavelength, whereas a global SoS assumption leads to artifactual localizations.\n",

Asset managers are beginning to require a prognostics and health management system to predict and assess maintenance decisions. These systems handle big machinery data and multi-sensor fusion and integrate remaining useful life prognostic capabilities. We introduce a deep adversarial learning approach to damage prognostics. A non-Markovian variational inference-based model incorporating an adversarial training algorithm framework was developed. The proposed framework was applied to a public multi-sensor data set of turbofan engines to demonstrate its ability to predict remaining useful life. We find that using the deep adversarial based approach results in higher performing remaining useful life predictions.\n",

Our algorithm combines the advantages of both grid-based and optimization-based approaches, and generates safe, dynamically feasible trajectories without suffering from an erroneous optimization setup such as imposing infeasible collision constraints. We adopt a sequential optimization method with \\textit{dummy agents} to improve the scalability of the algorithm, and utilize the convex hull property of Bernstein and relative Bernstein polynomial to replace non-convex collision avoidance constraints to convex ones. The proposed method can compute the trajectory for 64 agents on average 6.36 seconds with Intel Core i7-7700 @ 3.60GHz CPU and 16G RAM, and it reduces more than $50\\%$ of the objective cost compared to our previous work. We validate the proposed algorithm through simulation and flight tests.\n",

      "        Background music affects lyrics intelligibility of singing vocals in a music piece. Automatic lyrics alignment and transcription in polyphonic music are challenging tasks because the singing vocals are corrupted by the background music. In this work, we propose to learn music genre-specific characteristics to train polyphonic acoustic models. We first compare several automatic speech recognition pipelines for the application of lyrics transcription. We then present the lyrics alignment and transcription performance of music-informed acoustic models for the best-performing pipeline, and systematically study the impact of music genre and language model on the performance. With such genre-based approach, we explicitly model the music without removing it during acoustic modeling. The proposed approach outperforms all competing systems in the lyrics alignment and transcription tasks on several well-known polyphonic test datasets.\n",

      "        Implantation of stents into coronary arteries is a common treatment option for patients with cardiovascular disease. Assessment of safety and efficacy of the stent implantation occurs via manual visual inspection of the neointimal coverage from intravascular optical coherence tomography (IVOCT) images. However, such manual assessment requires the detection of thousands of strut points within the stent. This is a challenging, tedious, and time-consuming task because the strut points usually appear as small, irregular shaped objects with inhomogeneous textures, and are often occluded by shadows, artifacts, and vessel walls. Conventional methods based on textures, edge detection, or simple classifiers for automated detection of strut points in IVOCT images have low recall and precision as they are, unable to adequately represent the visual features of the strut point for detection. In this study, we propose a local-global refinement network to integrate local-patch content with global content for strut points detection from IVOCT images. Our method densely detects the potential strut points in local image patches and then refines them according to global appearance constraints to reduce false positives. Our experimental results on a clinical dataset of 7,000 IVOCT images demonstrated that our method outperformed the state-of-the-art methods with a recall of 0.92 and precision of 0.91 for strut points detection.\n",

      "        In this paper, we investigate an energy cost minimization problem for a smart home in the absence of a building thermal dynamics model with the consideration of a comfortable temperature range. Due to the existence of model uncertainty, parameter uncertainty (e.g., renewable generation output, non-shiftable power demand, outdoor temperature, and electricity price) and temporally-coupled operational constraints, it is very challenging to determine the optimal energy management strategy for scheduling Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems and energy storage systems in the smart home. To address the challenge, we first formulate the above problem as a Markov decision process, and then propose an energy management strategy based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG). It is worth mentioning that the proposed strategy does not require the prior knowledge of uncertain parameters and building thermal dynamics model. Simulation results based on real-world traces demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed strategy.\n",

      "        Several methods to perform extrapolation of unknown anatomy were evaluated. The primary application is to enhance surgical procedures that may use partial medical images or medical images of incomplete anatomy. Le Fort-based, face-jaw-teeth transplant is one such procedure. From CT data of 36 skulls and 21 mandibles separate Statistical Shape Models of the anatomical surfaces were created. Using the Statistical Shape Models, incomplete surfaces were projected to obtain complete surface estimates. The surface estimates exhibit non-zero error in regions where the true surface is known; it is desirable to keep the true surface and seamlessly merge the estimated unknown surface. Existing extrapolation techniques produce non-smooth transitions from the true surface to the estimated surface, resulting in additional error and a less aesthetically pleasing result. The three extrapolation techniques evaluated were: copying and pasting of the surface estimate (non-smooth baseline), a feathering between the patient surface and surface estimate, and an estimate generated via a Thin Plate Spline trained from displacements between the surface estimate and corresponding vertices of the known patient surface. Feathering and Thin Plate Spline approaches both yielded smooth transitions. However, feathering corrupted known vertex values. Leave-one-out analyses were conducted, with 5% to 50% of known anatomy removed from the left-out patient and estimated via the proposed approaches. The Thin Plate Spline approach yielded smaller errors than the other two approaches, with an average vertex error improvement of 1.46 mm and 1.38 mm for the skull and mandible respectively, over the baseline approach.\n",

      "        Cochlear implants (CIs) are a standard treatment for patients who experience severe to profound hearing loss. Recent studies have shown that hearing outcome is correlated with intra-cochlear anatomy and electrode placement. Our group has developed image-guided CI programming (IGCIP) techniques that use image analysis methods to both segment the inner ear structures in pre- or post-implantation CT images and localize the CI electrodes in post-implantation CT images. This permits to assist audiologists with CI programming by suggesting which among the contacts should be deactivated to reduce electrode interaction that is known to affect outcomes. Clinical studies have shown that IGCIP can improve hearing outcomes for CI recipients. However, the sensitivity of IGCIP with respect to the accuracy of the two major steps: electrode localization and intra-cochlear anatomy segmentation, is unknown. In this article, we create a ground truth dataset with conventional CT and micro-CT images of 35 temporal bone specimens to both rigorously characterize the accuracy of these two steps and assess how inaccuracies in these steps affect the overall results. Our study results show that when clinical pre- and post-implantation CTs are available, IGCIP produces results that are comparable to those obtained with the corresponding ground truth in 86.7% of the subjects tested. When only post-implantation CTs are available, this number is 83.3%. These results suggest that our current method is robust to errors in segmentation and localization but also that it can be improved upon.\n",

      "        We investigate the power and performance improvement in image acquisition devices by the use of CAS (Compressed Acquisition Scheme) and DNN (Deep Neural Networks). Towards this end, we propose a novel image acquisition scheme HCAS (Hardware based Compressed Acquisition Scheme) using hardware-based binning (downsampling), bit truncation and JPEG compression and develop a deep learning based reconstruction network for images acquired using the same. HCAS is motivated by the fact that in-situ compression of raw data using binning and bit truncation results in reduction in data traffic and power in the entire downstream image processing pipeline and additional compression of processed data using JPEG will help in storage/transmission of images. The combination of in-situ compression with JPEG leads to high compression ratios, significant power savings with further advantages of image acquisition simplification. Bearing these concerns in mind, we propose DRCAS (Deep Restoration network for hardware based Compressed Acquisition Scheme), which to our best knowledge, is the first work proposed in the literature for restoration of images acquired using acquisition scheme like HCAS. When compared with the CAS methods (bicubic downsampling) used in super resolution tasks in literature, HCAS proposed in this paper performs superior in terms of both compression ratio and being hardware friendly. The restoration network DRCAS also perform superior than state-of-the-art super resolution networks while being much smaller. Thus HCAS and DRCAS technique will enable us to design much simpler and power efficient image acquisition pipelines.\n",

The proposed algorithm does not need the prior knowledge about the number of DoAs and outperforms the existing methods in distinguishing extremely close DoAs for the case of one-bit quantization. Both the DoAs and the channel coefficients are estimated for the case of one-bit quantization. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has effective estimation performances when the DoAs are very close to each other.\n",

It is assumed that the receiver is a linear minimum mean-square (LMMS) receiver. The architecture is based on the deployment of macro base stations with large antenna arrays and a secondary tier of small cell base stations having fewer number of antenna arrays. The key contribution of the paper is to highlight the noticeable impact of CEE on the sum-rate capacity of macro-cells. Furthermore, it is shown that CEE has only marginal impact on the sum-rate capacity of small cells. Simulations for the sum rate of macro users versus that of the small cell users for time-division duplex (TDD) are performed and the results are compared with the case when channel estimation error is present.\n",

      "        The linear error-correcting codes are known to be well suited for battling and correcting the burst errors caused by noise in the wireless data transmission system. However, different types of codes offer different decoding and burst-error-correcting capabilities. This paper compares the Low-Density-Parity Check (LDPC) and Reed Solomon (RS) encoding schemes in battling and correcting the burst error caused by the clipping distortion occurred due to the dynamic range constraints in an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based Visible Light Communication (VLC). The unipolar conversion applied to the output of the multiplexer in this system results in a clipping noise which distorts the data symbols on the subcarriers in OFDM block. Considering that such distortion impacts the data symbol on each subcarrier differently, RS and LDP are used to encode the data block before being modulated for mapping the OFDM block. In order to control the extreme value of the output of the multiplexer, the transmitter applies puncturing to the generated codeword before mapping OFDM subcarriers, leaving the corresponding subcarriers of the punctured symbols empty. This will lead to the reduction of clipping events in the optical front-end and will mitigate the impact of nonlinear distortion on the modulated symbols for the occupied subcarriers. The redundancy in the codeword generated by the encoder is used not only to control the clipping probability by shortening the number of active subcarriers but also for the reconstruction of the original codeword and correction of the errors caused by channel noise. This work investigates the ability of LDCP and RS encoders in battling the effects of clipping noise in the frequency domain and compares their performances in improving the bit error ratio (BER) performance of an OFDM-based VLC.\n",

A main quadcopter flying using a primary battery has a docking platform attached to it. A 'flying battery' - a small quadcopter carrying a secondary battery - is equipped with docking legs that can mate with the main quadcopter's platform. Connectors between the legs and the platform establish electrical contact on docking, and enable power transfer from the secondary battery to the main quadcopter. A custom-designed circuit allows arbitrary switching between the primary battery and secondary battery. We demonstrate the concept in a flight experiment involving repeated docking, battery switching, and undocking. The experiment increases the flight time of the main quadcopter by a factor of 4.7x compared to solo flight, and 2.2x a theoretical limit for that given multirotor. Importantly, this increase in flight time is not associated with a large increase in overall vehicle mass or size, leaving the main quadcopter in fundamentally the same safety class.\n",

      "        We present the Distributed and Localized Model Predictive Control (DLMPC) algorithm for large-scale structured linear systems, wherein only local state and model information needs to be exchanged between subsystems for the computation and implementation of control actions. We use the System Level Synthesis (SLS) framework to reformulate the MPC problem as an optimization problem over closed loop system responses, and show that this allows us to naturally impose localized communication constraints between sub-controllers, such that only local state and system model information needs to be exchanged for both computation and implementation of closed loop MPC control policies. In particular, we show that the structure of the resulting optimization problem can be exploited to develop an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm that allows for distributed and localized computation of control decisions. Moreover, our approach can accommodate constraints and objective functions that couple the behavior of different subsystems, so long as the coupled systems are able to communicate directly with each other, allowing for a broader class of MPC problems to be solved via distributed optimization. We conclude with numerical simulations to demonstrate the usefulness of our method, and in particular, we demonstrate that the computational complexity of the subproblems solved by each subsystem in DLMPC is independent of the size of the global system.\n",

The agents are connected in a directed topology and an agent can communicate only to its neighbors connected through a directed edge in the network-connectivity structure. In this article, we propose a novel gradient-based distributed method to solve the above multi-agent convex optimization problem. In this method each agent maintains an estimate of the optimal solution. During each iteration of the proposed algorithm, the agents utilize locally available gradient information along with a finite-time approximate consensus protocol to move towards the optimal solution (hence the name \"gradient-consensus\" method). We show that the proposed algorithm converges linearly if the aggregate function $f$ is strongly convex and smooth. We also establish that the proposed method has a superior linear rate of convergence until reaching an $O(η)$ neighborhood of the optimal objective function value, for a given $η&gt; 0$, under the relaxed assumptions of $f_i$'s being convex and smooth. To the best of our knowledge the proposed method achieves a convergence rate better than the best known rate estimates existing in the literature under these assumptions. Further, we numerically evaluate our proposed algorithms by solving three distributed optimization problems and show the enhanced efficacy of the gradient-consensus method over the existing distributed optimization schemes.\n",

      "        Fuzzy logic is an accepted and well-developed approach for constructing verbal models. Fuzzy based methods are getting more popular, while the engineers deal with more daily life tasks. This paper presents a new Python toolkit for Interval Type 2 Fuzzy Logic Systems (IT2FLS). Developing software tools is an important issue for facilitating the practical use of theoretical results. There are limited tools for implementing IT2FLSs in Python. The developed PyIT2FLS is providing a set of tools for fast and easy modeling of fuzzy systems. This paper includes a brief description of how developed toolkit can be used. Also, three examples are given showing the usage of the developed toolkit for simulating IT2FLSs. First, a simple rule-based system is developed and it's codes are presented in the paper. The second example is the prediction of the Mackey-Glass chaotic time series using IT2FLS. In this example, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used for determining system parameters while minimizing the mean square error. In the last example, an IT2FPID is designed and used for controlling a linear time-delay system. The code for the examples are available on toolkit's GitHub page: \\url{https://github.com/Haghrah/PyIT2FLS}. The simulations and their results confirm the ability of the developed toolkit to be used in a wide range of the applications.\n",

The proposed method does not require uncertainty estimation or a persistent excitation assumption. Using the element-wise non-symmetric projection algorithm, the adaptive parameters are restricted to satisfy certain optimality conditions leading to overall closed loop system stability. Furthermore, a sliding mode controller with a time-varying sliding surface, working in tandem with the adaptive control allocation, is proposed to guarantee the outer loop stability and reference tracking in the presence of control allocation errors and disturbances. Simulation results are provided, where the Aerodata Model in Research Environment is used as an over-actuated system with actuator saturation, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n",

      "        In this paper, we address the much-anticipated deployment of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in society by modeling and analyzing the social-mobility dilemma in a game-theoretic approach. We formulate this dilemma as a normal-form game by constructing an intuitive payoff function inspired by the socially beneficial outcomes of a mobility system consisting of CAVs. We show that the game is equivalent to the Prisoner's dilemma, which implies that the rational collective decision is the opposite of the socially optimum (e.g., Tragedy of the Commons). To tackle this phenomenon, we present two different approaches, i.e., one with a preference structure and the other with institutional arrangements. In the first approach, we implement a social mechanism that enforces players to non-CAV travel and derive a lower bound of players that leads to an equilibrium of non-CAV travel. In the second approach, we investigate the possibility of players bargaining to create an institution that enforces non-CAV travel. We show that as the number of players increases, the incentive ratio of non-CAV travel over CAV-travel tends to zero. We also perform a numerical study for the latter approach demonstrating the effectiveness of our results.\n",

      "        Domains such as logo synthesis, in which the data has a high degree of multi-modality, still pose a challenge for generative adversarial networks (GANs). Recent research shows that progressive training (ProGAN) and mapping network extensions (StyleGAN) enable both increased training stability for higher dimensional problems and better feature separation within the embedded latent space. However, these architectures leave limited control over shaping the output of the network, which is an undesirable trait in the case of logo synthesis. This paper explores a conditional extension to the StyleGAN architecture with the aim of firstly, improving on the low resolution results of previous research and, secondly, increasing the controllability of the output through the use of synthetic class-conditions. Furthermore, methods of extracting such class conditions are explored with a focus on the human interpretability, where the challenge lies in the fact that, by nature, visual logo characteristics are hard to define. The introduced conditional style-based generator architecture is trained on the extracted class-conditions in two experiments and studied relative to the performance of an unconditional model. Results show that, whilst the unconditional model more closely matches the training distribution, high quality conditions enabled the embedding of finer details onto the latent space, leading to more diverse output.\n",

      "        This paper develops a controller synthesis approach for a multi-agent system (MAS) with intermittent communication. We adopt a leader-follower scheme, where a mobile leader with absolute position sensors switches among a set of followers without absolute position sensors to provide each follower with intermittent state information.We model the MAS as a switched system. The followers are to asymptotically reach a predetermined consensus state. To guarantee the stability of the switched system and the consensus of the followers, we derive maximum and minimal dwell-time conditions to constrain the intervals between consecutive time instants at which the leader should provide state information to the same follower. Furthermore, the leader needs to satisfy practical constraints such as charging its battery and staying in specific regions of interest. Both the maximum and minimum dwell-time conditions and these practical constraints can be expressed by metric temporal logic (MTL) specifications. We iteratively compute the optimal control inputs such that the leader satisfies the MTL specifications, while guaranteeing stability and consensus of the followers. We implement the proposed method on a case study with three mobile robots as the followers and one quadrotor as the leader.\n",

      "        This paper proposes a distributed dual gradient tracking algorithm (DDGT) to solve resource allocation problems over an unbalanced network, where each node in the network holds a private cost function and computes the optimal resource by interacting only with its neighboring nodes. Our key idea is the novel use of the distributed push-pull gradient algorithm (PPG) to solve the dual problem of the resource allocation problem. To study the convergence of the DDGT, we first establish the sublinear convergence rate of PPG for non-convex objective functions, which advances the existing results on PPG as they require the strong-convexity of objective functions. Then we show that the DDGT converges linearly for strongly convex and Lipschitz smooth cost functions, and sublinearly without the Lipschitz smoothness. Finally, experimental results suggest that DDGT outperforms existing algorithms.\n",

      "        Natural muscles provide mobility in response to nerve impulses. Electromyography (EMG) measures the electrical activity of muscles in response to a nerve's stimulation. In the past few decades, EMG signals have been used extensively in the identification of user intention to potentially control assistive devices such as smart wheelchairs, exoskeletons, and prosthetic devices. In the design of conventional assistive devices, developers optimize multiple subsystems independently. Feature extraction and feature description are essential subsystems of this approach. Therefore, researchers proposed various hand-crafted features to interpret EMG signals. However, the performance of conventional assistive devices is still unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach to control prosthetic hands with raw EMG signals. We use a novel deep convolutional neural network to eschew the feature-engineering step. Removing the feature extraction and feature description is an important step toward the paradigm of end-to-end optimization. Fine-tuning and personalization are additional advantages of our approach. The proposed approach is implemented in Python with TensorFlow deep learning library, and it runs in real-time in general-purpose graphics processing units of NVIDIA Jetson TX2 developer kit. Our results demonstrate the ability of our system to predict fingers position from raw EMG signals. We anticipate our EMG-based control system to be a starting point to design more sophisticated prosthetic hands. For example, a pressure measurement unit can be added to transfer the perception of the environment to the user. Furthermore, our system can be modified for other prosthetic devices.\n",

      "        The purpose of sparse modelling of ECG signals is to represent an ECG record, given by sample points, as a linear combination of as few elementary components as possible. This can be achieved by creating a redundant set, called a dictionary, from where the elementary components are selected. The success in sparsely representing an ECG record depends on the nature of the dictionary being considered. In this paper we focus on the construction of different families of wavelet dictionaries, which are appropriate for the purpose of reducing dimensionality of ECG signals through sparse representation modelling. The suitability of wavelet dictionaries for ECG modelling, applying the Optimized Orthogonal Matching Pursuit approach for the selection process, was demonstrated in a previous work on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database consisting of 48 records each of which of 30 min length. This paper complements the previous one by presenting the technical details, methods, algorithms, and MATLAB software facilitating the construction of different families of wavelet dictionaries. The implementation allows for straightforward further extensions to include additional wavelet families. The sparsity in the representation of an ECG record significantly improves in relation to the sparsity produced by the corresponding wavelet basis. This result holds true for the 17 wavelet families considered here.\n",

Either asynchronism or channel dispersion causes multiple access interference (MAI), which degrades performance. Conditions with small timing offsets we term quasi-synchronous (QS). In this paper, we investigate binary CSS signaling in QS conditions. We derive the bit error probability analytically and validate both numerical and simulation results with our theoretical result for any time-frequency (TF) chirp waveform. We also propose two new sets of nonlinear chirps to improve CSS system performance. We numerically evaluate cross-correlation distributions, and show that in practical QS conditions our two new nonlinear chirp designs outperform the classical linear chirp and multiple existing nonlinear chirps from the literature. We also demonstrate that our nonlinear CSS designs outperform existing chirps in two realistic (empirically modeled) dispersive air to ground channels.\n",

      "        This paper applies the principles of continuum mechanics to safely and resiliently coordinate a multi-agent team. A hybrid automation with two operation modes, Homogeneous Deformation Mode (HDM) and Containment Exclusion Mode (CEM), are developed to robustly manage group coordination in the presence of unpredicted agent failures. HDM becomes active when all agents are healthy, where the group coordination is defined by homogeneous transformation coordination functions. By classifying agents as leaders and followers, a desired n-D homogeneous transformation is uniquely related to the desired trajectories of n+1 leaders and acquired by the remaining followers in real-time through local communication. The paper offers a novel approach for leader selection as well as naturally establishing and reestablishing inter-agent communication whenever the agent team enters the HDM. CEM is activated when at least one agent fails to admit group coordination. This paper applies unique features of decentralized homogeneous transformation coordination to quickly detect each arising anomalous situation and excludes failed agent(s) from group coordination of healthy agents. In CEM, agent coordination is treated as an ideal fluid flow where the desired agents' paths are defined along stream lines inspired by fluid flow field theory to circumvent exclusion spaces surrounding failed agent(s).\n",

Our methods are based on unrolling of proximal forward-backward splitting (PFBS) framework with data-driven image regularization via deep neural networks. In contrast with PFBS-IR that utilizes standard data fidelity updates via iterative reconstruction (IR) method, PFBS-AIR involves preconditioned data fidelity updates that fuse analytical reconstruction (AR) method and IR in a synergistic way, I.e. fused analytical and iterative reconstruction (AIR). The results suggest that DL-regularized methods (PFBS-IR and PFBS-AIR) provided better reconstruction quality from conventional wisdoms (AR or IR), and DL-based postprocessing method (FBPConvNet). In addition, owing to AIR, PFBS-AIR noticeably outperformed PFBS-IR.\n",

      "        This paper addresses distributed parameter estimation in randomized one-hidden-layer neural networks. A group of agents sequentially receive measurements of an unknown parameter that is only partially observable to them. In this paper, we present a fully distributed estimation algorithm where agents exchange local estimates with their neighbors to collectively identify the true value of the parameter. We prove that this distributed update provides an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the unknown parameter, i.e., the first moment of the expected global error converges to zero asymptotically. We further analyze the efficiency of the proposed estimation scheme by establishing an asymptotic upper bound on the variance of the global error. Applying our method to a real-world dataset related to appliances energy prediction, we observe that our empirical findings verify the theoretical results.\n",

      "        Move blocking (MB) is a widely used strategy to reduce the degrees of freedom of the Optimal Control Problem (OCP) arising in receding horizon control. The size of the OCP is reduced by forcing the input variables to be constant over multiple discretization steps. In this paper, we focus on developing computationally efficient MB schemes for multiple shooting based nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC). The degrees of freedom of the OCP is reduced by introducing MB in the shooting step, resulting in a smaller but sparse OCP. Therefore, the discretization accuracy and level of sparsity is maintained. A condensing algorithm that exploits the sparsity structure of the OCP is proposed, that allows to reduce the computation complexity of condensing from quadratic to linear in the number of discretization nodes. As a result, active-set methods with warm-start strategy can be efficiently employed, thus allowing the use of a longer prediction horizon. A detailed comparison between the proposed scheme and the nonuniform grid NMPC is given. Effectiveness of the algorithm in reducing computational burden while maintaining optimization accuracy and constraints fulfillment is shown by means of simulations with two different problems.\n",

A three-layer architecture is suggested that consists of a meta-layer that decides the intermediate goals, an action-layer that selects local actions as the agent navigates towards a goal, and a classification-layer that evaluates the reward and makes a prediction. We design and implement these layers using deep reinforcement learning. A generalized policy gradient algorithm is utilized to learn the parameters of these layers to maximize the expected reward. Our proposed methodology is tested on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, which provides us with a level of explainability while interpreting the agent's intermediate goals and course of action.\n",

      "        This paper proposes a safety analysis method that facilitates a tunable balance between worst-case and risk-neutral perspectives. First, we define a risk-sensitive safe set to specify the degree of safety attained by a stochastic system. This set is defined as a sublevel set of the solution to an optimal control problem that is expressed using the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) measure. This problem does not satisfy Bellman's Principle, thus our next contribution is to show how risk-sensitive safe sets can be under-approximated by the solution to a CVaR-Markov Decision Process. Our third and fourth contributions are to show that a value iteration algorithm solves the reduced problem and enables tractable policy synthesis for a class of linear systems. Fifth, we develop a realistic numerical example of a stormwater system to show that our approach can be applied to non-linear systems. Finally, we compare the CVaR criterion to the exponential disutility criterion. The latter allocates control effort evenly across the cost distribution to reduce variance, while the CVaR criterion focuses control effort on a given worst-case quantile--where it matters most for safety.\n",

The standard DRA assumes that the administrator has constantly full information and instantaneous access to the entire network. Towards bringing such strategies closer to real-life constraints, we first present the Restricted DRA model extension where, at each intervention round, the access is restricted to only a fraction of the network nodes, called sample. Then, inspired by sequential selection problems such as the well-known Secretary Problem, we propose the Sequential DRA (SDRA) model. Our model introduces a sequential aspect in the decision process over the sample of each round, offering a completely new perspective to the dynamic DP control. Finally, we incorporate several sequential selection algorithms to SDRA control strategies and compare their performance in SIS epidemic simulations.\n",

      "        Seismic attributes calculated by conventional methods are susceptible to noise. Conventional filtering reduces the noise in the cost of losing the spectral bandwidth. The challenge of having a high-resolution and robust signal processing tool motivated us to propose a sparse time-frequency decomposition while is stabilized for random noise. The procedure initiates by using Sparsity-based adaptive S-transform to regularize abrupt variations in frequency content of the nonstationary signals. Then, considering the fact that a higher amplitude of a frequency component results in a higher signal to noise ratio, an adaptive filter is applied to the time-frequency spectrum which is sparcified previously. The proposed zero adaptive filter enhances the high amplitude frequency components while suppresses the lower ones. The performance of the proposed method is compared to the sparse S-transform and the robust window Hilbert transform in estimation of instantaneous attributes by applying on synthetic and real data sets. Seismic attributes estimated by the proposed method is superior to the conventional ones in terms of its robustness and high resolution image. The proposed approach has a vast application in interpretation and identification of geological structures.\n",

      "        Most current super-resolution methods rely on low and high resolution image pairs to train a network in a fully supervised manner. However, such image pairs are not available in real-world applications. Instead of directly addressing this problem, most works employ the popular bicubic downsampling strategy to artificially generate a corresponding low resolution image. Unfortunately, this strategy introduces significant artifacts, removing natural sensor noise and other real-world characteristics. Super-resolution networks trained on such bicubic images therefore struggle to generalize to natural images. In this work, we propose an unsupervised approach for image super-resolution. Given only unpaired data, we learn to invert the effects of bicubic downsampling in order to restore the natural image characteristics present in the data. This allows us to generate realistic image pairs, faithfully reflecting the distribution of real-world images. Our super-resolution network can therefore be trained with direct pixel-wise supervision in the high resolution domain, while robustly generalizing to real input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in quantitative and qualitative experiments.\n",

      "        3D computer-assisted corrective osteotomy has become the state-of-the-art for surgical treatment of complex bone deformities. Despite available technologies, the automatic generation of clinically acceptable, ready-to-use preoperative planning solutions is currently not possible for such pathologies. Multiple contradicting and mutually dependent objectives have to be considered, as well as clinical and technical constraints, generally requiring iterative manual adjustments. This leads to unnecessary efforts and unbearable clinical costs, hindering also the quality of patient treatment. In this paper, we propose an optimization framework for the generation of ready-to-use preoperative planning solutions in a fully automatic fashion. An automatic diagnostic assessment using patient-specific 3D models is performed for 3D malunion quantification and definition of the optimization parameters. Afterward, clinical objectives are translated into the optimization module, and controlled through tailored fitness functions based on a weighted and multi-staged optimization approach. The optimization is based on a genetic algorithm capable of solving multi-objective optimization problems with non-linear constraints. The framework outputs a complete preoperative planning solution including position and orientation of the osteotomy plane, transformation to achieve the bone reduction, and position and orientation of the fixation plate and screws. A qualitative validation was performed on 36 consecutive cases of radius osteotomy where solutions generated by the optimization algorithm (OA) were compared against the gold standard (GS) solutions generated by experienced surgeons. Solutions were blinded and presented to 6 readers, who voted OA solutions to be better in 55% of the time. The quantitative evaluation was based on different error measurements, showing average improvements with respect to the GS.\n",

      "        The simulation of two-dimensional (2D) wave propagation is an affordable computational task and its use can potentially improve time performance in vocal tracts' acoustic analysis. Several models have been designed that rely on 2D wave solvers and include 2D representations of three-dimensional (3D) vocal tract-like geometries. However, until now, only the acoustics of straight 3D tubes with circular cross-sections have been successfully replicated with this approach. Furthermore, the simulation of the resulting 2D shapes requires extremely high spatio-temporal resolutions, dramatically reducing the speed boost deriving from the usage of a 2D wave solver. In this paper, we introduce an in-progress novel vocal tract model that extends the 2D Finite-Difference Time-Domain wave solver (2.5D FDTD) by adding tube depth, derived from the area functions, to the acoustic solver. The model combines the speed of a light 2D numerical scheme with the ability to natively simulate 3D tubes that are symmetric in one dimension, hence relaxing previous resolution requirements. An implementation of the 2.5D FDTD is presented, along with evaluation of its performance in the case of static vowel modeling. The paper discusses the current features and limits of the approach, and the potential impact on computational acoustics applications.\n",

      "        The segmentation of prostate whole gland and transition zone in Diffusion Weighted MRI (DWI) are the first step in designing computer-aided detection algorithms for prostate cancer. However, variations in MRI acquisition parameters and scanner manufacturing result in different appearances of prostate tissue in the images. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which have shown to be successful in various medical image analysis tasks including segmentation are typically sensitive to the variations in imaging parameters. This sensitivity leads to poor segmentation performance of CNNs trained on a source cohort and tested on a target cohort from a different scanner and hence, it limits the applicability of CNNs for cross-cohort training and testing. Contouring prostate whole gland and transition zone in DWI images are time-consuming and expensive. Thus, it is important to enable CNNs pretrained on images of source domain, to segment images of target domain with minimum requirement for manual segmentation of images from the target domain. In this work, we propose a transfer learning method based on a modified U-net architecture and loss function, for segmentation of prostate whole gland and transition zone in DWIs using a CNN pretrained on a source dataset and tested on the target dataset. We explore the effect of the size of subset of target dataset used for fine-tuning the pre-trained CNN on the overall segmentation accuracy. Our results show that with a fine-tuning data as few as 30 patients from the target domain, the proposed transfer learning-based algorithm can reach dice score coefficient of 0.80 for both prostate whole gland and transition zone segmentation. Using a fine-tuning data of 115 patients from the target domain, dice score coefficient of 0.85 and 0.84 are achieved for segmentation of whole gland and transition zone, respectively, in the target domain.\n",
