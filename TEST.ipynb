       "['Purpose: To improve the image quality of highly accelerated multi-channel MRI data by learning a joint variational network that reconstructs multiple clinical contrasts jointly.\\n  Methods: Data from our multi-contrast acquisition was embedded into the variational network architecture where shared anatomical information is exchanged by mixing the input contrasts. Complementary k-space sampling across imaging contrasts and Bunch-Phase/Wave-Encoding were used for data acquisition to improve the reconstruction at high accelerations. At 3T, our joint variational network approach across T1w, T2w and T2-FLAIR-weighted brain scans was tested for retrospective under-sampling at R=6 (2D) and R=4x4 (3D) acceleration. Prospective acceleration was also performed for 3D data where the combined acquisition time for whole brain coverage at 1 mm isotropic resolution across three contrasts was less than three minutes.\\n  Results: Across all test datasets, our joint multi-contrast network better preserved fine anatomical details with reduced image-blurring when compared to the corresponding single-contrast reconstructions. Improvement in image quality was also obtained through complementary k-space sampling and Bunch-Phase/Wave-Encoding where the synergistic combination yielded the overall best performance as evidenced by exemplarily slices and quantitative error metrics.\\n  Conclusion: By leveraging shared anatomical structures across the jointly reconstructed scans, our joint multi-contrast approach learnt more efficient regularizers which helped to retain natural image appearance and avoid over-smoothing. When synergistically combined with advanced encoding techniques, the performance was further improved, enabling up to R=16-fold acceleration with good image quality. This should help pave the way to very rapid high-resolution brain exams.',\n",
       " 'We propose Nonlinear Dipole Inversion (NDI) for high-quality Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) without regularization tuning, while matching the image quality of state-of-the-art reconstruction techniques. In addition to avoiding over-smoothing that these techniques often suffer from, we also obviate the need for parameter selection. NDI is flexible enough to allow for reconstruction from an arbitrary number of head orientations, and outperforms COSMOS even when using as few as 1-direction data. This is made possible by a nonlinear forward-model that uses the magnitude as an effective prior, for which we derived a simple gradient descent update rule. We synergistically combine this physics-model with a Variational Network (VN) to leverage the power of deep learning in the VaNDI algorithm. This technique adopts the simple gradient descent rule from NDI and learns the network parameters during training, hence requires no additional parameter tuning. Further, we evaluate NDI at 7T using highly accelerated Wave-CAIPI acquisitions at 0.5 mm isotropic resolution and demonstrate high-quality QSM from as few as 2-direction data.',\n",
       " 'The performance and diagnostic utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in pregnancy is fundamentally constrained by fetal motion. Motion of the fetus, which is unpredictable and rapid on the scale of conventional imaging times, limits the set of viable acquisition techniques to single-shot imaging with severe compromises in signal-to-noise ratio and diagnostic contrast, and frequently results in unacceptable image quality. Surprisingly little is known about the characteristics of fetal motion during MRI and here we propose and demonstrate methods that exploit a growing repository of MRI observations of the gravid abdomen that are acquired at low spatial resolution but relatively high temporal resolution and over long durations (10-30 minutes). We estimate fetal pose per frame in MRI volumes of the pregnant abdomen via deep learning algorithms that detect key fetal landmarks. Evaluation of the proposed method shows that our framework achieves quantitatively an average error of 4.47 mm and 96.4\\\\% accuracy (with error less than 10 mm). Fetal pose estimation in MRI time series yields novel means of quantifying fetal movements in health and disease, and enables the learning of kinematic models that may enhance prospective mitigation of fetal motion artifacts during MRI acquisition.',\n",

Time-course analysis for in-utero volumetric MRI time series often suffers from substantial and unpredictable fetal motion. Registration provides voxel correspondences between images and is commonly employed for motion correction. Current registration methods often fail when aligning images that are substantially different from a template (reference image). To achieve accurate and robust alignment, we make a Markov assumption on the nature of motion and take advantage of the temporal smoothness in the image data. Forward message passing in the corresponding hidden Markov model (HMM) yields an estimation algorithm that only has to account for relatively small motion between consecutive frames. We evaluate the utility of the temporal model in the context of in-utero MRI time series alignment by examining the accuracy of propagated segmentation label maps. Our results suggest that the proposed model captures accurately the temporal dynamics of transformations in in-utero MRI time series.',\n",

       " '  A linear inverse problem is proposed that requires the determination of multiple unknown signal vectors. Each unknown vector passes through a different system matrix and the results are added to yield a single observation vector. Given the matrices and lone observation, the objective is to find a simultaneously sparse set of unknown vectors that solves the system. We will refer to this as the multiple-system single-output (MSSO) simultaneous sparsity problem. This manuscript contrasts the MSSO problem with other simultaneous sparsity problems and conducts a thorough initial exploration of algorithms with which to solve it. Seven algorithms are formulated that approximately solve this NP-Hard problem. Three greedy techniques are developed (matching pursuit, orthogonal matching pursuit, and least squares matching pursuit) along with four methods based on a convex relaxation (iteratively reweighted least squares, two forms of iterative shrinkage, and formulation as a second-order cone program). The algorithms are evaluated across three experiments: the first and second involve sparsity profile recovery in noiseless and noisy scenarios, respectively, while the third deals with magnetic resonance imaging radio-frequency excitation pulse design.',\n",
       " 'Heart Failure is a major component of healthcare expenditure and a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Despite higher inter-rater variability, endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is still regarded as the standard technique, used to identify the cause (e.g. ischemic or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction etc.) of unexplained heart failure. In this paper, we focus on identifying cardiomyopathy as ischemic or non-ischemic. For this, we propose and implement a new unified architecture comprising CNN (inception-V3 model) and bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) with self-attention mechanism to predict the ischemic or non-ischemic to classify cardiomyopathy using histopathological images. The proposed model is based on self-attention that implicitly focuses on the information outputted from the hidden layers of BiLSTM. Through our results we demonstrate that this framework carries a high learning capacity and is able to improve the classification performance.',\n",
       " 'Gliomas are the most common primary brain malignancies, with different degrees of aggressiveness, variable prognosis and various heterogeneous histologic sub-regions, i.e., peritumoral edematous/invaded tissue, necrotic core, active and non-enhancing core. This intrinsic heterogeneity is also portrayed in their radio-phenotype, as their sub-regions are depicted by varying intensity profiles disseminated across multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) scans, reflecting varying biological properties. Their heterogeneous shape, extent, and location are some of the factors that make these tumors difficult to resect, and in some cases inoperable. The amount of resected tumor is a factor also considered in longitudinal scans, when evaluating the apparent tumor for potential diagnosis of progression. Furthermore, there is mounting evidence that accurate segmentation of the various tumor sub-regions can offer the basis for quantitative image analysis towards prediction of patient overall survival. This study assesses the state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) methods used for brain tumor image analysis in mpMRI scans, during the last seven instances of the International Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge, i.e., 2012-2018. Specifically, we focus on i) evaluating segmentations of the various glioma sub-regions in pre-operative mpMRI scans, ii) assessing potential tumor progression by virtue of longitudinal growth of tumor sub-regions, beyond use of the RECIST/RANO criteria, and iii) predicting the overall survival from pre-operative mpMRI scans of patients that underwent gross total resection. Finally, we investigate the challenge of identifying the best ML algorithms for each of these tasks, considering that apart from being diverse on each instance of the challenge, the multi-institutional mpMRI BraTS dataset has also been a continuously evolving/growing dataset.',\n",

Rates of reliable communication are derived and source-channel separation for communication with fidelity criteria is proved. The results are then generalized to the multi-user setting under certain assumptions. Other applications of this problem problem which follow from this perspective are discussed.',\n",

It is assumed that random codes are permitted. The word \"universal\" in the title of this paper refers to the fact that the channel model is compound. The proof uses a layered black-box or a layered input-output view-point. In particular, only the end-to-end description of the channel as being capable of communicating a source to within a certain distortion level is used when proving separation. This implies that the channel model does not play any role for separation to hold as long as there is a source model. Further implications of the layered black-box view-point are discussed.\\n  Optimality of source-medium separation for multi-user communication with fidelity criteria over a general, compound medium in the unicast setting is proved in Part II, thus generalizing Part I to the unicast, multi-user setting.\\n  Part III gets to an understanding of the question, \"Why is a channel which is capable of communicating a source to within a certain distortion level, also capable of communicating bits at any rate less than the infimum of the rates needed to code the source to within the distortion level\": this lies at the heart of why optimality of separation for communication with a fidelity criterion holds.

       " 'Learning robotic manipulation tasks using reinforcement learning with sparse rewards is currently impractical due to the outrageous data requirements. Many practical tasks require manipulation of multiple objects, and the complexity of such tasks increases with the number of objects. Learning from a curriculum of increasingly complex tasks appears to be a natural solution, but unfortunately, does not work for many scenarios. We hypothesize that the inability of the state-of-the-art algorithms to effectively utilize a task curriculum stems from the absence of inductive biases for transferring knowledge from simpler to complex tasks. We show that graph-based relational architectures overcome this limitation and enable learning of complex tasks when provided with a simple curriculum of tasks with increasing numbers of objects. We demonstrate the utility of our framework on a simulated block stacking task. Starting from scratch, our agent learns to stack six blocks into a tower. Despite using step-wise sparse rewards, our method is orders of magnitude more data-efficient and outperforms the existing state-of-the-art method that utilizes human demonstrations. Furthermore, the learned policy exhibits zero-shot generalization, successfully stacking blocks into taller towers and previously unseen configurations such as pyramids, without any further training.',\n",

When they are not actuated, wheels are free moving and do not consume battery power. The payload transport system is modeled as an actuated multi-agent system, with each wheel-motor pair as an agent. Kinematic and dynamic models are developed to ensure that the payload transport system moves as desired. We design optimization formulations to decide on the number of wheels to be active and which of the wheels to be active so that the battery is conserved and the wear on the motors is reduced. Our multi-level control framework over the agents ensures that near-optimal number of agents is active for the payload transport system to function. Through simulation studies we show that our solution ensures energy efficient operation and increases the distance traveled by the payload transport system, for the same battery power. We have built the payload transport system and provide results for preliminary experimental validation.',\n",

In experiments with neural networks, we show that a surprisingly large number of models can be effectively stored within a single parameter instance. Furthermore, each of these models can undergo thousands of training steps without significantly interfering with other models within the superposition.

To deal with noisy training signal for segmenting objects obtained by self-supervised interactions, we propose robust set loss. A dataset of robot's interactions along-with a few human labeled examples is provided as a benchmark for future research.

       " \"The current dominant paradigm for imitation learning relies on strong supervision of expert actions to learn both 'what' and 'how' to imitate. We pursue an alternative paradigm wherein an agent first explores the world without any expert supervision and then distills its experience into a goal-conditioned skill policy with a novel forward consistency loss. In our framework, the role of the expert is only to communicate the goals (i.e., what to imitate) during inference. The learned policy is then employed to mimic the expert (i.e., how to imitate) after seeing just a sequence of images demonstrating the desired task. Our method is 'zero-shot' in the sense that the agent never has access to expert actions during training or for the task demonstration at inference. We evaluate our zero-shot imitator in two real-world settings: complex rope manipulation with a Baxter robot and navigation in previously unseen office environments with a TurtleBot. Through further experiments in VizDoom simulation, we provide evidence that better mechanisms for exploration lead to learning a more capable policy which in turn improves end task performance.

       " 'What makes humans so good at solving seemingly complex video games? Unlike computers, humans bring in a great deal of prior knowledge about the world, enabling efficient decision making. This paper investigates the role of human priors for solving video games. Given a sample game, we conduct a series of ablation studies to quantify the importance of various priors on human performance. We do this by modifying the video game environment to systematically mask different types of visual information that could be used by humans as priors. We find that removal of some prior knowledge causes a drastic degradation in the speed with which human players solve the game, e.g. from 2 minutes to over 20 minutes. Furthermore, our results indicate that general priors, such as the importance of objects and visual consistency, are critical for efficient game-play.

We hypothesized that advances in computer vision could enable building a fully automated, scalable analysis pipeline for echocardiogram (echo) interpretation. Our approach entailed: 1) preprocessing; 2) convolutional neural networks (CNN) for view identification, image segmentation, and phasing of the cardiac cycle; 3) quantification of chamber volumes and left ventricular mass; 4) particle tracking to compute longitudinal strain; and 5) targeted disease detection. CNNs accurately identified views (e.g. 99% for apical 4-chamber) and segmented individual cardiac chambers. Cardiac structure measurements agreed with study report values (e.g. mean absolute deviations (MAD) of 7.7 mL/kg/m2 for left ventricular diastolic volume index, 2918 studies). We computed automated ejection fraction and longitudinal strain measurements (within 2 cohorts), which agreed with commercial software-derived values [for ejection fraction, MAD=5.3%, N=3101 studies; for strain, MAD=1.5% (n=197) and 1.6% (n=110)], and demonstrated applicability to serial monitoring of breast cancer patients for trastuzumab cardiotoxicity. Overall, we found that, compared to manual measurements, automated measurements had superior performance across seven internal consistency metrics with an average increase in the Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.05 (p=0.02). Finally, we developed disease detection algorithms for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and cardiac amyloidosis, with C-statistics of 0.93 and 0.84, respectively. Our pipeline lays the groundwork for using automated interpretation to support point-of-care handheld cardiac ultrasound and large-scale analysis of the millions of echos archived within healthcare systems.',\n",
       " \"In many real-world scenarios, rewards extrinsic to the agent are extremely sparse, or absent altogether. In such cases, curiosity can serve as an intrinsic reward signal to enable the agent to explore its environment and learn skills that might be useful later in its life. We formulate curiosity as the error in an agent's ability to predict the consequence of its own actions in a visual feature space learned by a self-supervised inverse dynamics model. Our formulation scales to high-dimensional continuous state spaces like images, bypasses the difficulties of directly predicting pixels, and, critically, ignores the aspects of the environment that cannot affect the agent. The proposed approach is evaluated in two environments: VizDoom and Super Mario Bros. Three broad settings are investigated: 1) sparse extrinsic reward, where curiosity allows for far fewer interactions with the environment to reach the goal; 2) exploration with no extrinsic reward, where curiosity pushes the agent to explore more efficiently; and 3) generalization to unseen scenarios (e.g. new levels of the same game) where the knowledge gained from earlier experience helps the agent explore new places much faster than starting from scratch.

We present a learning-based system where a robot takes as input a sequence of images of a human manipulating a rope from an initial to goal configuration, and outputs a sequence of actions that can reproduce the human demonstration, using only monocular images as input. To perform this task, the robot learns a pixel-level inverse dynamics model of rope manipulation directly from images in a self-supervised manner, using about 60K interactions with the rope collected autonomously by the robot. The human demonstration provides a high-level plan of what to do and the low-level inverse model is used to execute the plan. We show that by combining the high and low-level plans, the robot can successfully manipulate a rope into a variety of target shapes using only a sequence of human-provided images for direction.',\n",

In this work we introduce a basic set of tasks that require agents to estimate properties such as mass and cohesion of objects in an interactive simulated environment where they can manipulate the objects and observe the consequences. We found that state of art deep reinforcement learning methods can learn to perform the experiments necessary to discover such hidden properties. By systematically manipulating the problem difficulty and the cost incurred by the agent for performing experiments, we found that agents learn different strategies that balance the cost of gathering information against the cost of making mistakes in different situations.',\n",

This work provides an empirical investigation of various facets of this question: Is more pre-training data always better? How does feature quality depend on the number of training examples per class? Does adding more object classes improve performance? For the same data budget, how should the data be split into classes? Is fine-grained recognition necessary for learning good features? Given the same number of training classes, is it better to have coarse classes or fine-grained classes? Which is better: more classes or more examples per class? To answer these and related questions, we pre-trained CNN features on various subsets of the ImageNet dataset and evaluated transfer performance on PASCAL detection, PASCAL action classification, and SUN scene classification tasks. Our overall findings suggest that most changes in the choice of pre-training data long thought to be critical do not significantly affect transfer performance.?

We propose a novel approach based on deep neural networks for modeling the dynamics of robot's interactions directly from images, by jointly estimating forward and inverse models of dynamics. The inverse model objective provides supervision to construct informative visual features, which the forward model can then predict and in turn regularize the feature space for the inverse model. The interplay between these two objectives creates useful, accurate models that can then be used for multi-step decision making. This formulation has the additional benefit that it is possible to learn forward models in an abstract feature space and thus alleviate the need of predicting pixels.

Our models directly process raw visual input, and use a novel object-centric prediction formulation based on visual glimpses centered on objects (fixations) to enforce translational invariance of the learned physical laws. The agent gathers training data through random interaction with a collection of different environments, and the resulting model can then be used to plan goal-directed actions in novel environments that the agent has not seen before.

Here we propose a framework that expands the expressive power of hierarchical feature extractors to encompass both input and output spaces, by introducing top-down feedback. Instead of directly predicting the outputs in one go, we use a self-correcting model that progressively changes an initial solution by feeding back error predictions, in a process we call Iterative Error Feedback (IEF).

Drawing inspiration from this observation, in this work we investigate if the awareness of egomotion can be used as a supervisory signal for feature learning. As opposed to the knowledge of class labels, information about egomotion is freely available to mobile agents.

       " 'The human brain is adept at solving difficult high-level visual processing problems such as image interpretation and object recognition in natural scenes. Over the past few years neuroscientists have made remarkable progress in understanding how the human brain represents categories of objects and actions in natural scenes. However, all current models of high-level human vision operate on hand annotated images in which the objects and actions have been assigned semantic tags by a human operator. No current models can account for high-level visual function directly in terms of low-level visual input (i.e., pixels). To overcome this fundamental limitation we sought to develop a new class of models that can predict human brain activity directly from low-level visual input (i.e., pixels). We explored two classes of models drawn from computer vision and machine learning. The first class of models was based on Fisher Vectors (FV) and the second was based on Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). We find that both classes of models accurately predict brain activity in high-level visual areas, directly from pixels and without the need for any semantic tags or hand annotation of images. This is the first time that such a mapping has been obtained. The fit models provide a new platform for exploring the functional principles of human vision, and they show that modern methods of computer vision and machine learning provide important tools for characterizing brain function.',\n",

Motivated by these difficulties and drawing upon a long history of research in multi-armed bandits, we introduce Bao (the BAndit Optimizer). Bao takes advantage of the wisdom built into existing query optimizers by providing per-query optimization hints. Bao combines modern tree convolutional neural networks with Thompson sampling, a decades-old and well-studied reinforcement learning algorithm. As a result, Bao automatically learns from its mistakes and adapts to changes in query workloads, data, and schema. Experimentally, we demonstrate that Bao can quickly (an order of magnitude faster than previous approaches) learn strategies that improve end-to-end query execution performance, including tail latency. In cloud environments, we show that Bao can offer both reduced costs and better performance compared with a sophisticated commercial system.',\n",
       " 'Inferring road attributes such as lane count and road type from satellite imagery is challenging. Often, due to the occlusion in satellite imagery and the spatial correlation of road attributes, a road attribute at one position on a road may only be apparent when considering far-away segments of the road. Thus, to robustly infer road attributes, the model must integrate scattered information and capture the spatial correlation of features along roads. Existing solutions that rely on image classifiers fail to capture this correlation, resulting in poor accuracy. We find this failure is caused by a fundamental limitation -- the limited effective receptive field of image classifiers. To overcome this limitation, we propose RoadTagger, an end-to-end architecture which combines both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to infer road attributes. The usage of graph neural networks allows information propagation on the road network graph and eliminates the receptive field limitation of image classifiers. We evaluate RoadTagger on both a large real-world dataset covering 688 km^2 area in 20 U.S. cities and a synthesized micro-dataset. In the evaluation, RoadTagger improves inference accuracy over the CNN image classifier based approaches. RoadTagger also demonstrates strong robustness against different disruptions in the satellite imagery and the ability to learn complicated inductive rules for aggregating scattered information along the road network.',\n",
       " 'Scanning and filtering over multi-dimensional tables are key operations in modern analytical database engines. To optimize the performance of these operations, databases often create clustered indexes over a single dimension or multi-dimensional indexes such as R-trees, or use complex sort orders (e.g., Z-ordering). However, these schemes are often hard to tune and their performance is inconsistent across different datasets and queries. In this paper, we introduce Flood, a multi-dimensional in-memory index that automatically adapts itself to a particular dataset and workload by jointly optimizing the index structure and data storage. Flood achieves up to three orders of magnitude faster performance for range scans with predicates than state-of-the-art multi-dimensional indexes or sort orders on real-world datasets and workloads. Our work serves as a building block towards an end-to-end learned database system.',\n",

However, in many parts of the world, street maps are incomplete or lag behind new construction. Editing maps today involves a tedious process of manually tracing and annotating roads, buildings, and other map features.\\n  Over the past decade, many automatic map inference systems have been proposed to automatically extract street map data from satellite imagery, aerial imagery, and GPS trajectory datasets. However, automatic map inference has failed to gain traction in practice due to two key limitations: high error rates (low precision), which manifest in noisy inference outputs, and a lack of end-to-end system design to leverage inferred data to update existing street maps.\\n  At MIT and QCRI, we have developed a number of algorithms and approaches to address these challenges, which we combined into a new system we call Mapster. Mapster is a human-in-the-loop street map editing system that incorporates three components to robustly accelerate the mapping process over traditional tools and workflows: high-precision automatic map inference, data refinement, and machine-assisted map editing.\\n  Through an evaluation on a large-scale dataset including satellite imagery, GPS trajectories, and ground-truth map data in forty cities, we show that Mapster makes automation practical for map editing, and enables the curation of map datasets that are more complete and up-to-date at less cost.',\n",

Widely deployed algorithms, such as DCTCP and DCQCN, are still far from optimal in many plausible scenarios, particularly for tail latency. Many operators compensate by running their networks at low average utilization, dramatically increasing costs.\\n  In this paper, we argue that we have reached the practical limits of end-to-end congestion control. Instead, we propose a new clean slate design based on hop-by-hop per-flow flow control. We show that our approach achieves near optimal tail latency behavior even under challenging conditions such as high link utilization and in-cast cross traffic. By contrast with prior hop-by-hop schemes, we show that per-flow flow control requires only limited metadata and packet buffering.',\n",
       " 'We present Placeto, a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to efficiently find device placements for distributed neural network training. Unlike prior approaches that only find a device placement for a specific computation graph, Placeto can learn generalizable device placement policies that can be applied to any graph. We propose two key ideas in our approach: (1) we represent the policy as performing iterative placement improvements, rather than outputting a placement in one shot; (2) we use graph embeddings to capture relevant information about the structure of the computation graph, without relying on node labels for indexing. These ideas allow Placeto to train efficiently and generalize to unseen graphs. Our experiments show that Placeto requires up to 6.1x fewer training steps to find placements that are on par with or better than the best placements found by prior approaches. Moreover, Placeto is able to learn a generalizable placement policy for any given family of graphs, which can then be used without any retraining to predict optimized placements for unseen graphs from the same family. This eliminates the large overhead incurred by prior RL approaches whose lack of generalizability necessitates re-training from scratch every time a new graph is to be placed.',\n",

Systems to automatically infer road network graphs from aerial imagery and GPS trajectories have been proposed to improve coverage of road maps. However, because of high error rates, these systems have not been adopted by mapping communities. We propose machine-assisted map editing, where automatic map inference is integrated into existing, human-centric map editing workflows. To realize this, we build Machine-Assisted iD (MAiD), where we extend the web-based OpenStreetMap editor, iD, with machine-assistance functionality. We complement MAiD with a novel approach for inferring road topology from aerial imagery that combines the speed of prior segmentation approaches with the accuracy of prior iterative graph construction methods. We design MAiD to tackle the addition of major, arterial roads in regions where existing maps have poor coverage, and the incremental improvement of coverage in regions where major roads are already mapped. We conduct two user studies and find that, when participants are given a fixed time to map roads, they are able to add as much as 3.5x more roads with MAiD.',\n",

Several recently proposed learning-based approaches achieve promising results on simple channel models (e.g., i.i.d. Gaussian).

We propose MMNet, a deep learning MIMO detection scheme that significantly outperforms existing approaches on realistic channels with the same or lower computational complexity. MMNet's design builds on the theory of iterative soft-thresholding algorithms and uses a novel training algorithm that leverages temporal and spectral correlation to accelerate training. Together, these innovations allow MMNet to train online for every realization of the channel. On i.i.d. Gaussian channels, MMNet requires two orders of magnitude fewer operations than existing deep learning schemes but achieves near-optimal performance. On spatially-correlated channels, it achieves the same error rate as the next-best learning scheme (OAMPNet) at 2.5dB lower SNR and with at least 10x less computational complexity. MMNet is also 4--8dB better overall than a classic linear scheme like the minimum mean square error (MMSE) detector.\",\n",

Pointwise convolutions, which we refer to as channel fusions, are the main computational bottleneck in the state-of-the-art efficient CNNs (e.g. MobileNets ). We introduce a set of criteria for channel fusion and prove that BFT yields an asymptotically optimal FLOP count with respect to these criteria. By replacing pointwise convolutions with BFT, we reduce the computational complexity of these layers from O(n^2) to O(n\\\\log n) with respect to the number of channels. Our experimental evaluations show that our method results in significant accuracy gains across a wide range of network architectures, especially at low FLOP ranges. For example, BFT results in up to a 6.75% absolute Top-1 improvement for MobileNetV1, 4.4 \\\\% for ShuffleNet V2 and 5.4% for MobileNetV3 on ImageNet under a similar number of FLOPS.

ABC routers mark each packet with an \"accelerate\" or \"brake\", which causes senders to slightly increase or decrease their congestion windows. Routers use this feedback to quickly guide senders towards a desired target rate. ABC requires no changes to header formats or user devices, but achieves better performance than XCP. ABC is also incrementally deployable; it operates correctly when the bottleneck is a non-ABC router, and can coexist with non-ABC traffic sharing the same bottleneck link. We evaluate ABC using a Wi-Fi implementation and trace-driven emulation of cellular links. ABC achieves 30-40% higher throughput than Cubic+Codel for similar delays, and 2.2X lower delays than BBR on a Wi-Fi path. On cellular network paths, ABC achieves 50% higher throughput than Cubic+Codel.',\n",

Neo bootstraps its query optimization model from existing optimizers and continues to learn from incoming queries, building upon its successes and learning from its failures. Furthermore, Neo naturally adapts to underlying data patterns and is robust to estimation errors. Experimental results demonstrate that Neo, even when bootstrapped from a simple optimizer like PostgreSQL, can learn a model that offers similar performance to state-of-the-art commercial optimizers, and in some cases even surpass them.',\n",

If in addition to blocking the transmission, metallic layers have the feature of blocking the reflection, too, they would make perfect absorbers. In this work, we propose an experimental approach of using a single thin layer of Manganese (Mn) as both the transmission suppresser and the reflection suppresser. This approach leads to obtaining lithography-free ultra-broadband perfect absorption in an ultra-wide spectrum ranging from Ultraviolet (UV) to Far Infrared (FIR). The measured average absorption is approximately 99%. Such a promising result can be achieved by only coating a single Mn layer on high-roughness substrates that include random nano-pyramids on it. In other words, we do not need a stack of different materials and combinations of geometrical features. The high roughness is realized on a commercial Silicon wafer substrate by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching. The key to this ultra-wideband absorption is electromagnetic field tapering which exists due to the graded-index feature of the structure (known as moth-eye effect), along with the ideal optical properties of Mn which makes it an excellent metal for broadband absorption applications. A full experimental characterization of the fabricated samples is presented along with the physical analysis of the phenomena. The findings of this paper can be used for the realization of lithography-free, cost-effective and high-throughput mass production of broadband absorbers.',\n",

Current systems, however, use simple generalized heuristics and ignore workload characteristics, since developing and tuning a scheduling policy for each workload is infeasible. In this paper, we show that modern machine learning techniques can generate highly-efficient policies automatically. Decima uses reinforcement learning (RL) and neural networks to learn workload-specific scheduling algorithms without any human instruction beyond a high-level objective such as minimizing average job completion time. Off-the-shelf RL techniques, however, cannot handle the complexity and scale of the scheduling problem. To build Decima, we had to develop new representations for jobs' dependency graphs, design scalable RL models, and invent RL training methods for dealing with continuous stochastic job arrivals. Our prototype integration with Spark on a 25-node cluster shows that Decima improves the average job completion time over hand-tuned scheduling heuristics by at least 21%, achieving up to 2x improvement during periods of high cluster load.\",\n",

Payment channel networks (PCNs) such as the Lightning Network have emerged as a viable scaling solution. However, completing payments on PCNs is challenging: payments must be routed on paths with sufficient funds. As payments flow over a single channel (link) in the same direction, the channel eventually becomes depleted and cannot support further payments in that direction; hence, naive routing schemes like shortest-path routing can deplete key payment channels and paralyze the system. Today\\'s PCNs also route payments atomically, worsening the problem. In this paper, we present Spider, a routing solution that \"packetizes\" transactions and uses a multi-path transport protocol to achieve high-throughput routing in PCNs. Packetization allows Spider to complete even large transactions on low-capacity payment channels over time, while the multi-path congestion control protocol ensures balanced utilization of channels and fairness across flows. Extensive simulations comparing Spider with state-of-the-art approaches shows that Spider requires less than 25% of the funds to successfully route over 95% of transactions on balanced traffic demands, and offloads 4x more transactions onto the PCN on imbalanced demands.',\n",

Input processes arise in many applications, including queuing systems, robotics control with disturbances, and object tracking. Since the state dynamics and rewards depend on the input process, the state alone provides limited information for the expected future returns. Therefore, policy gradient methods with standard state-dependent baselines suffer high variance during training. We derive a bias-free, input-dependent baseline to reduce this variance, and analytically show its benefits over state-dependent baselines. We then propose a meta-learning approach to overcome the complexity of learning a baseline that depends on a long sequence of inputs. Our experimental results show that across environments from queuing systems, computer networks, and MuJoCo robotic locomotion, input-dependent baselines consistently improve training stability and result in better eventual policies.',\n",

To estimate elasticity, Nimbus modulates the flow\\'s sending rate with sinusoidal pulses that create small traffic fluctuations at the bottleneck link, and measures the frequency response of the rate of the cross traffic. Our results on emulated and real-world paths show that congestion control using elasticity detection achieves throughput comparable to Cubic, but with delays that are 50-70 ms lower when cross traffic is inelastic.

Ithemal uses a hierarchical LSTM--based approach to predict throughput based on the opcodes and operands of instructions in a basic block. We show that Ithemal is more accurate than state-of-the-art hand-written tools currently used in compiler backends and static machine code analyzers. In particular, our model has less than half the error of state-of-the-art analytical models (LLVM's llvm-mca and Intel's IACA). Ithemal is also able to predict these throughput values just as fast as the aforementioned tools, and is easily ported across a variety of processor microarchitectures with minimal developer effort.\",\n",

These resources, however, often exhibit poor utilization rates on workloads with large working sets, e.g., in-memory databases, key-value stores, and graph analytics, as compilers and hardware struggle to expose ILP and MLP from the instruction stream automatically.\\n  In this paper, we introduce the IMLP (Instruction and Memory Level Parallelism) task programming model. IMLP tasks execute as coroutines that yield execution at annotated long-latency operations, e.g., memory accesses, divisions, or unpredictable branches. IMLP tasks are interleaved on a single thread, and integrate well with thread parallelism and vectorization. Our DSL embedded in C++, Cimple, allows exploration of task scheduling and transformations, such as buffering, vectorization, pipelining, and prefetching.\\n  We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on core algorithms used in in-memory databases that operate on arrays, hash tables, trees, and skip lists. Cimple applications reach 2.5x throughput gains over hardware multithreading on a multi-core, and 6.4x single thread speedup.',\n",

Programmers must try different combinations of a large set of techniques to develop the best implementation for a specific algorithm and type of graph. Existing graph frameworks lack flexibility, supporting only a limited set of optimizations.\\n  This paper introduces GraphIt, a new DSL for graph computations that generates fast implementations for algorithms with different performance characteristics running on graphs with different sizes and structures. GraphIt separates what is computed (algorithm) from how it is computed (schedule). Programmers specify the algorithm using an algorithm language, and performance optimizations are specified using a scheduling language. The algorithm language simplifies expressing the algorithms. We formulate graph optimizations, including edge traversal direction, data layout, parallelization, cache, NUMA, and kernel fusion optimizations, as tradeoffs among locality, parallelism, and work-efficiency. The scheduling language enables programmers to easily search through this complicated tradeoff space by composing together optimizations. We also built an autotuner to automatically find high-performance schedules. The compiler uses a new scheduling representation, the graph iteration space, to model, compose, and ensure the validity of the large number of optimizations. GraphIt outperforms the next fastest of six state-of-the-art shared-memory frameworks (Ligra, Green-Marl, GraphMat, Galois, Gemini, and Grazelle) on 24 out of 32 experiments by up to 4.8$\\\\times$, and is never more than 43% slower than the fastest framework on the other experiments.

Tiramisu has two main features: it relies on a flexible representation based on the polyhedral model and it has a rich scheduling language allowing fine-grained control of optimizations. Tiramisu uses a four-level intermediate representation that allows full separation between the algorithms, loop transformations, data layouts, and communication. This separation simplifies targeting multiple hardware architectures with the same algorithm.

Our modular code generator design makes it simple to add support for new tensor formats, and the performance of the generated code is competitive with hand-optimized implementations. Furthermore, by extending taco to support a wider range of formats specialized for different application and data characteristics, we can improve end-user application performance.

Tiramisu introduces a novel three-level IR that separates the algorithm, how that algorithm is executed, and where intermediate data are stored. This separation simplifies optimization and makes targeting multiple hardware architectures from the same algorithm easier. As a result, DSL compilers can be made considerably less complex with no loss of performance while immediately targeting multiple hardware or hardware combinations such as distributed nodes with both CPUs and GPUs. We evaluated Tiramisu by creating a new middle-end for the Halide and Julia compilers. We show that Tiramisu extends Halide and Julia with many new capabilities including the ability to: express new algorithms (such as recurrent filters and non-rectangular iteration spaces), perform new complex loop nest transformations (such as wavefront parallelization, loop shifting and loop fusion) and generate efficient code for more architectures (such as combinations of distributed clusters, multicores, GPUs and FPGAs).

Weld exposes a lazily-evaluated API where diverse functions can submit their computations in a simple but general intermediate representation that captures their data-parallel structure. It then optimizes data movement across these functions and emits efficient code for diverse hardware.

Previous systems have applied out-of-core processing techniques from the memory/disk boundary to the cache/DRAM boundary. However, we find that blindly applying such techniques is ineffective because of the much smaller performance gap between DRAM and cache. We present two techniques that take advantage of the cache with minimal or no instruction overhead. The first, frequency based clustering, groups together frequently accessed vertices to improve the utilization of each cache line with no runtime overhead. The second, CSR segmenting, partitions the graph to restrict all random accesses to the cache, makes all DRAM access sequential, and merges partition results using a very low overhead cache-aware merge.

We begin with a synthetic data generation procedure, and train a model that can accurately interpret utterances produced by the data generator. To generalize to natural utterances, we automatically find projections of natural language utterances onto the support of the synthetic language, using learned sentence embeddings to define a distance metric. With only synthetic training data, our approach matches or outperforms state-of-the-art models trained on natural language data in several domains. These results suggest that simulation-to-real transfer is a practical framework for developing NLP applications, and that improved models for transfer might provide wide-ranging improvements in downstream tasks.\",\n",

Going beyond an earlier related benchmark that focused on syntactic aspects of generalization, gSCAN defines a language grounded in the states of a grid world. This allows us to build novel generalization tasks that probe the acquisition of linguistically motivated rules. For example, agents must understand how adjectives such as \\'small\\' are interpreted relative to the current world state or how adverbs such as \\'cautiously\\' combine with new verbs.

This implies that the iterates are always well-defined and that, as opposed to standard FOM, large variations in the approximation quality of consecutive iterates are avoided, although $0$ lies within the convex hull of the spectrum.

We propose to regularize CNNs using large-scale neuroscience data to learn more robust neural features in terms of representational similarity. We presented natural images to mice and measured the responses of thousands of neurons from cortical visual areas. Next, we denoised the notoriously variable neural activity using strong predictive models trained on this large corpus of responses from the mouse visual system, and calculated the representational similarity for millions of pairs of images from the model's predictions. We then used the neural representation similarity to regularize CNNs trained on image classification by penalizing intermediate representations that deviated from neural ones. This preserved performance of baseline models when classifying images under standard benchmarks, while maintaining substantially higher performance compared to baseline or control models when classifying noisy images. Moreover, the models regularized with cortical representations also improved model robustness in terms of adversarial attacks. This demonstrates that regularizing with neural data can be an effective tool to create an inductive bias towards more robust inference.\",\n",

Due to the low false alarm rate and the precise localization (23 deg$^2$ at 90\\\\%), S190814bv presented the community with the best opportunity yet to directly observe an optical/near-infrared counterpart to a NSBH merger. To search for potential counterparts, the GROWTH collaboration performed real-time image subtraction on 6 nights of public Dark Energy Camera (DECam) images acquired in the three weeks following the merger, covering $>$98\\\\% of the localization probability. Using a worldwide network of follow-up facilities, we systematically undertook spectroscopy and imaging of optical counterpart candidates. Combining these data with a photometric redshift catalog, we ruled out each candidate as the counterpart to S190814bv and we placed deep, uniform limits on the optical emission associated with S190814bv.

The residual and error operators are functions of the time stepping operator, analyzed directly and bounded in norm, both numerically and analytically. We present various upper bounds of different computational cost and varying sharpness. These upper bounds are complemented by proposing analytic formulae for the approximate convergence factor of V-cycle algorithms that take the number of fine grid time points, the temporal coarsening factors, and the eigenvalues of the time stepping operator as parameters.\\n  The paper concludes with supporting numerical investigations of parabolic (anisotropic diffusion) and hyperbolic (wave equation) model problems. We assess the sharpness of the bounds and the quality of the approximate convergence factors. Observations from these numerical investigations demonstrate the value of the proposed multilevel convergence framework for estimating MGRIT convergence a priori and for the design of a convergent algorithm. We further highlight that observations in the literature are captured by the theory, including that two-level Parareal and multilevel MGRIT with F-relaxation do not yield scalable algorithms and the benefit of a stronger relaxation scheme. An important observation is that with increasing numbers of levels MGRIT convergence deteriorates for the hyperbolic model problem, while constant convergence factors can be achieved for the diffusion equation.

However, both modes of task specification have their disadvantages: reward functions require manual engineering, while demonstrations require a human expert to be able to actually perform the task in order to generate the demonstration. Instruction following from natural language instructions provides an appealing alternative: in the same way that we can specify goals to other humans simply by speaking or writing, we would like to be able to specify tasks for our machines. However, a single instruction may be insufficient to fully communicate our intent or, even if it is, may be insufficient for an autonomous agent to actually understand how to perform the desired task.

The same is then true for the ratios of $Λ^{(4)}/Λ^{(5)}$ and $Λ^{(3)}/Λ^{(4)}$, which play a major rôle in connecting lattice determinations of $α^{(3)}_{MSbar}$ from the three-flavor theory with $α^{(5)}_{MSbar}(M_Z)$. Also the charm quark content of the nucleon, relevant for dark matter searches, can be computed accurately from perturbation theory.\\n  We investigate a very closely related model, namely QCD with $N_f=2$ heavy quarks. Our non-perturbative information is derived from simulations on the lattice, with masses up to the charm quark mass and lattice spacings down to about 0.023 fm followed by a continuum extrapolation. The non-perturbative mass dependence agrees within rather small errors with the perturbative prediction at masses around the charm quark mass. Surprisingly, from studying solely the massive theory we can make a prediction for the ratio $Q^{1/\\\\sqrt{t_0}}_{0,2}=[Λ\\\\sqrt{t_0(0)}]_{N_f=2}/[Λ\\\\sqrt{t_0}]_{N_f=0}$, which refers to the chiral limit in $N_f=2$. Here $t_0$ is the Gradient Flow scale of [1]. The uncertainty for $Q$ is estimated to be 2.5%. For the phenomenologically interesting $Λ^{(3)}/Λ^{(4)}$, we conclude that perturbation theory introduces errors which are at most at the 1.5% level, far smaller than other current uncertainties.',\n",
       " 'Objective: To (1) demonstrate the implementation of a data science platform built on open-source technology within a large, academic healthcare system and (2) describe two computational healthcare applications built on such a platform. Materials and Methods: A data science platform based on several open source technologies was deployed to support real-time, big data workloads. Data acquisition workflows for Apache Storm and NiFi were developed in Java and Python to capture patient monitoring and laboratory data for downstream analytics. Results: The use of emerging data management approaches along with open-source technologies such as Hadoop can be used to create integrated data lakes to store large, real-time data sets. This infrastructure also provides a robust analytics platform where healthcare and biomedical research data can be analyzed in near real-time for precision medicine and computational healthcare use cases. Discussion: The implementation and use of integrated data science platforms offer organizations the opportunity to combine traditional data sets, including data from the electronic health record, with emerging big data sources, such as continuous patient monitoring and real-time laboratory results. These platforms can enable cost-effective and scalable analytics for the information that will be key to the delivery of precision medicine initiatives. Conclusion: Organizations that can take advantage of the technical advances found in data science platforms will have the opportunity to provide comprehensive access to healthcare data for computational healthcare and precision medicine research.',\n",
       " \"In complex inferential tasks like question answering, machine learning models must confront two challenges: the need to implement a compositional reasoning process, and, in many applications, the need for this reasoning process to be interpretable to assist users in both development and prediction. Existing models designed to produce interpretable traces of their decision-making process typically require these traces to be supervised at training time. In this paper, we present a novel neural modular approach that performs compositional reasoning by automatically inducing a desired sub-task decomposition without relying on strong supervision. Our model allows linking different reasoning tasks though shared modules that handle common routines across tasks. Experiments show that the model is more interpretable to human evaluators compared to other state-of-the-art models: users can better understand the model's underlying reasoning procedure and predict when it will succeed or fail based on observing its intermediate outputs.\",\n",
       " 'Calcium imaging has revolutionized systems neuroscience, providing the ability to image large neural populations with single-cell resolution. The resulting datasets are quite large, which has presented a barrier to routine open sharing of this data, slowing progress in reproducible research. State of the art methods for analyzing this data are based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF); these approaches solve a non-convex optimization problem, and are effective when good initializations are available, but can break down in low-SNR settings where common initialization approaches fail. Here we introduce an approach to compressing and denoising functional imaging data. The method is based on a spatially-localized penalized matrix decomposition (PMD) of the data to separate (low-dimensional) signal from (temporally-uncorrelated) noise. This approach can be applied in parallel on local spatial patches and is therefore highly scalable, does not impose non-negativity constraints or require stringent identifiability assumptions (leading to significantly more robust results compared to NMF), and estimates all parameters directly from the data, so no hand-tuning is required. We have applied the method to a wide range of functional imaging data (including one-photon, two-photon, three-photon, widefield, somatic, axonal, dendritic, calcium, and voltage imaging datasets): in all cases, we observe ~2-4x increases in SNR and compression rates of 20-300x with minimal visible loss of signal, with no adjustment of hyperparameters; this in turn facilitates the process of demixing the observed activity into contributions from individual neurons. We focus on two challenging applications: dendritic calcium imaging data and voltage imaging data in the context of optogenetic stimulation. In both cases, we show that our new approach leads to faster and much more robust extraction of activity from the data.',\n",
       " 'Navigation guided by natural language instructions presents a challenging reasoning problem for instruction followers. Natural language instructions typically identify only a few high-level decisions and landmarks rather than complete low-level motor behaviors; much of the missing information must be inferred based on perceptual context. In machine learning settings, this is doubly challenging: it is difficult to collect enough annotated data to enable learning of this reasoning process from scratch, and also difficult to implement the reasoning process using generic sequence models. Here we describe an approach to vision-and-language navigation that addresses both these issues with an embedded speaker model. We use this speaker model to (1) synthesize new instructions for data augmentation and to (2) implement pragmatic reasoning, which evaluates how well candidate action sequences explain an instruction. Both steps are supported by a panoramic action space that reflects the granularity of human-generated instructions. Experiments show that all three components of this approach---speaker-driven data augmentation, pragmatic reasoning and panoramic action space---dramatically improve the performance of a baseline instruction follower, more than doubling the success rate over the best existing approach on a standard benchmark.',\n",

Our pragmatics-enabled models reason about why speakers produce certain instructions, and about how listeners will react upon hearing them.

We extend these models to tasks with sequential structure. Evaluation of language generation and interpretation shows that pragmatic inference improves state-of-the-art listener models (at correctly interpreting human instructions) and speaker models (at producing instructions correctly interpreted by humans) in diverse settings.',\n",
       " 'Deep reinforcement learning has achieved many recent successes, but our understanding of its strengths and limitations is hampered by the lack of rich environments in which we can fully characterize optimal behavior, and correspondingly diagnose individual actions against such a characterization. Here we consider a family of combinatorial games, arising from work of Erdos, Selfridge, and Spencer, and we propose their use as environments for evaluating and comparing different approaches to reinforcement learning. These games have a number of appealing features: they are challenging for current learning approaches, but they form (i) a low-dimensional, simply parametrized environment where (ii) there is a linear closed form solution for optimal behavior from any state, and (iii) the difficulty of the game can be tuned by changing environment parameters in an interpretable way. We use these Erdos-Selfridge-Spencer games not only to compare different algorithms, but test for generalization, make comparisons to supervised learning, analyse multiagent play, and even develop a self play algorithm.

       " \"The named concepts and compositional operators present in natural language provide a rich source of information about the kinds of abstractions humans use to navigate the world. Can this linguistic background knowledge improve the generality and efficiency of learned classifiers and control policies? This paper aims to show that using the space of natural language strings as a parameter space is an effective way to capture natural task structure. In a pretraining phase, we learn a language interpretation model that transforms inputs (e.g. images) into outputs (e.g. labels) given natural language descriptions. To learn a new concept (e.g. a classifier), we search directly in the space of descriptions to minimize the interpreter's loss on training examples. Crucially, our models do not require language data to learn these concepts: language is used only in pretraining to impose structure on subsequent learning. Results on image classification, text editing, and reinforcement learning show that, in all settings, models with a linguistic parameterization outperform those without.\",\n",

Our algorithm can globally localize and track a robot with a priori unknown location, given an informative prior map of the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. Also, we formulate the problem as an optimization problem that serves as the Back-end of the algorithm mentioned above (Front-end). Thus, by simultaneously solving for the robot trajectory and the map of BLE beacons, we recover a continuous and smooth trajectory of the robot, corrected locations of the BLE beacons, and the time-varying IMU bias. The evaluations achieved using hardware show that through the proposed closed-loop system the localization performance can be improved; furthermore, the system becomes robust to the error in the map of beacons by feeding back the optimized map to the Front-end.',\n",

Instead we develop a translation model based on the insight that agent messages and natural language strings mean the same thing if they induce the same belief about the world in a listener. We present theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence that our approach preserves both the semantics and pragmatics of messages by ensuring that players communicating through a translation layer do not suffer a substantial loss in reward relative to players with a common language.\",\n",
       " 'Natural language questions are inherently compositional, and many are most easily answered by reasoning about their decomposition into modular sub-problems. For example, to answer \"is there an equal number of balls and boxes?\" we can look for balls, look for boxes, count them, and compare the results. The recently proposed Neural Module Network (NMN) architecture implements this approach to question answering by parsing questions into linguistic substructures and assembling question-specific deep networks from smaller modules that each solve one subtask. However, existing NMN implementations rely on brittle off-the-shelf parsers, and are restricted to the module configurations proposed by these parsers rather than learning them from data. In this paper, we propose End-to-End Module Networks (N2NMNs), which learn to reason by directly predicting instance-specific network layouts without the aid of a parser. Our model learns to generate network structures (by imitating expert demonstrations) while simultaneously learning network parameters (using the downstream task loss). Experimental results on the new CLEVR dataset targeted at compositional question answering show that N2NMNs achieve an error reduction of nearly 50% relative to state-of-the-art attentional approaches, while discovering interpretable network architectures specialized for each question.',\n",

Most prior work focuses on either grounding entire referential expressions holistically to one region, or localizing relationships based on a fixed set of categories. In this paper we instead present a modular deep architecture capable of analyzing referential expressions into their component parts, identifying entities and relationships mentioned in the input expression and grounding them all in the scene.

Sketches annotate tasks with sequences of named subtasks, providing information about high-level structural relationships among tasks but not how to implement them---specifically not providing the detailed guidance used by much previous work on learning policy abstractions for RL (e.g. intermediate rewards, subtask completion signals, or intrinsic motivations). To learn from sketches, we present a model that associates every subtask with a modular subpolicy, and jointly maximizes reward over full task-specific policies by tying parameters across shared subpolicies. Optimization is accomplished via a decoupled actor--critic training objective that facilitates learning common behaviors from multiple dissimilar reward functions. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in three environments featuring both discrete and continuous control, and with sparse rewards that can be obtained only after completing a number of high-level subgoals. Experiments show that using our approach to learn policies guided by sketches gives better performance than existing techniques for learning task-specific or shared policies, while naturally inducing a library of interpretable primitive behaviors that can be recombined to rapidly adapt to new tasks.',\n",

The game levels introduce the concepts one by one, as players are tasked with sliding the penguin through a landscape towards a specific location, while keeping the velocity under control. When the player manipulates the landscape, the potential energy of the penguin is changed, which determines the penguin's movement. To build a strong connection between theory and game the analytical expressions for kinetic and potential energy are displayed during play with font sizes continually growing and shrinking according to changes in each energy type. With Potential Penguin we hope to study whether visualizing the amount of kinetic and potential energy through visible mathematical expressions generates a connection between the intuitive actions taken in the game and the underlying physics concepts.

This should be possible with improved environmental control, greater stability in the illumination of the spectrometer optics, better detectors, more precise wavelength calibration, and broader bandwidth spectra. Key data analysis challenges for the precision radial velocity community include distinguishing center of mass Keplerian motion from photospheric velocities, and the proper treatment of telluric contamination. Success here is coupled to the instrument design, but also requires the implementation of robust statistical and modeling techniques. Center of mass velocities produce Doppler shifts that affect every line identically, while photospheric velocities produce line profile asymmetries with wavelength and temporal dependencies that are different from Keplerian signals.\\n  Exoplanets are an important subfield of astronomy and there has been an impressive rate of discovery over the past two decades. Higher precision radial velocity measurements are required to serve as a discovery technique for potentially habitable worlds and to characterize detections from transit missions. The future of exoplanet science has very different trajectories depending on the precision that can ultimately be achieved with Doppler measurements.',\n",
       " \"Differentiation is a mathematical skill applied throughout science in order to describe the change of a function with respect to a dependent variable. Thus, an intuitive understanding of differentiation is necessary to work with the mathematical frameworks used to describe physical systems in the higher levels of education. In order to obtain this intuition repeated practice is required. This paper presents the development of DiffGame, which consists of a series of exercises that introduce the basic principles of differentiation for high-school students through game-like elements. DiffGame have been tested with 117 first-year students from a single Danish high school, who did not have any prior training in differentiation. The students' learning was assessed by the data obtained directly from DiffGame. The test demonstrated the efficacy of DiffGame, since students at all levels demonstrate a learning gain. In contrast to previous studies demonstrating most learning in the lower tier of students, the middle tier of students (based on overall performance) exhibits the largest learning gains.\",\n",

The model uses natural language strings to automatically assemble neural networks from a collection of composable modules. Parameters for these modules are learned jointly with network-assembly parameters via reinforcement learning, with only (world, question, answer) triples as supervision. Our approach, which we term a dynamic neural model network, achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets in both visual and structured domains.',\n",
       " \"The characterization of a physically-diverse set of transiting exoplanets is an important and necessary step towards establishing the physical properties linked to the production of obscuring clouds or hazes. It is those planets with identifiable spectroscopic features that can most effectively enhance our understanding of atmospheric chemistry and metallicity. The newly-commissioned LDSS-3C instrument on Magellan provides enhanced sensitivity and suppressed fringing in the red optical, thus advancing the search for the spectroscopic signature of water in exoplanetary atmospheres from the ground. Using data acquired by LDSS-3C and the Spitzer Space Telescope, we search for evidence of water vapor in the transmission spectrum of the Neptune-mass planet HAT-P-26b. Our measured spectrum is best explained by the presence of water vapor, a lack of potassium, and either a high-metallicity, cloud-free atmosphere or a solar-metallicity atmosphere with a cloud deck at ~10 mbar. The emergence of multi-scale-height spectral features in our data suggests that future observations at higher precision could break this degeneracy and reveal the planet's atmospheric chemical abundances. We also update HAT-P-26b's transit ephemeris, t_0 = 2455304.65218(25) BJD_TDB, and orbital period, p = 4.2345023(7) days.\",\n",
       " 'Visual question answering is fundamentally compositional in nature---a question like \"where is the dog?\" shares substructure with questions like \"what color is the dog?\" and \"where is the cat?\" This paper seeks to simultaneously exploit the representational capacity of deep networks and the compositional linguistic structure of questions. We describe a procedure for constructing and learning *neural module networks*, which compose collections of jointly-trained neural \"modules\" into deep networks for question answering. Our approach decomposes questions into their linguistic substructures, and uses these structures to dynamically instantiate modular networks (with reusable components for recognizing dogs, classifying colors, etc.). The resulting compound networks are jointly trained. We evaluate our approach on two challenging datasets for visual question answering, achieving state-of-the-art results on both the VQA natural image dataset and a new dataset of complex questions about abstract shapes.',\n",

We present our virtual learning environment \\\\emph{StudentResearcher} which incorporates simulations, multiple-choice quizzes, video lectures and gamification into a learning path for quantum mechanics at the advanced university level. \\\\emph{StudentResearcher} is built upon the experiences gathered from workshops with the citizen science game Quantum Moves at the high-school and university level, where the games were used extensively to illustrate the basic concepts of quantum mechanics. The first test of this new virtual learning environment was a 2014 course in advanced quantum mechanics at Aarhus University with 47 enrolled students. We found increased learning for the students who were more active on the platform independent of their previous performances.',\n",
       " 'Crowdscience games may hold unique potentials as learning opportunities compared to games made for fun or education. They are part of an actual science problem solving process: By playing, players help scientists, and thereby interact with real continuous research processes. This mixes the two worlds of play and science in new ways. During usability testing we discovered that users of the crowdscience game Quantum Dreams tended to answer questions in game terms, even when directed explicitly to give science explanations.We then examined these competing frames of understanding through a mixed correlational and grounded theory analysis. This essay presents the core ideas of crowdscience games as learning opportunities, and reports how a group of players used \"game\", \"science\" and \"conceptual\" frames to interpret their experience. Our results suggest that oscillating between the frames instead of sticking to just one led to the largest number of correct science interpretations, as players could participate legitimately and autonomously at multiple levels of understanding.',\n",

We approach instruction following as a search over plans, scoring sequences of actions conditioned on structured observations of text and the environment. By explicitly modeling both the low-level compositional structure of individual actions and the high-level structure of full plans, we are able to learn both grounded representations of sentence meaning and pragmatic constraints on interpretation. To demonstrate the model's flexibility, we apply it to a diverse set of benchmark tasks. On every task, we outperform strong task-specific baselines, and achieve several new state-of-the-art results.\",\n",
       " 'The Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) is part of the Pierre Auger Observatory and is used to detect the radio emission of cosmic-ray air showers. These observations are compared to the data of the surface detector stations of the Observatory, which provide well-calibrated information on the cosmic-ray energies and arrival directions. The response of the radio stations in the 30 to 80 MHz regime has been thoroughly calibrated to enable the reconstruction of the incoming electric field. For the latter, the energy deposit per area is determined from the radio pulses at each observer position and is interpolated using a two-dimensional function that takes into account signal asymmetries due to interference between the geomagnetic and charge-excess emission components. The spatial integral over the signal distribution gives a direct measurement of the energy transferred from the primary cosmic ray into radio emission in the AERA frequency range. We measure 15.8 MeV of radiation energy for a 1 EeV air shower arriving perpendicularly to the geomagnetic field. This radiation energy -- corrected for geometrical effects -- is used as a cosmic-ray energy estimator. Performing an absolute energy calibration against the surface-detector information, we observe that this radio-energy estimator scales quadratically with the cosmic-ray energy as expected for coherent emission. We find an energy resolution of the radio reconstruction of 22% for the data set and 17% for a high-quality subset containing only events with at least five radio stations with signal.',\n",

We find that shape-controlled antiferromagnetic domain states give rise to a significant reduction of the switching field of the rectangular nanomagnets. This is discussed in the framework of competition between an intrinsic spin-flop coupling and shape anisotropy. The data demonstrates that shape effects in antiferromagnets may be used to control the magnetic properties in nanomagnets.',\n",
       " 'Humans routinely solve problems of immense computational complexity by intuitively forming simple, low-dimensional heuristic strategies. Citizen science exploits this ability by presenting scientific research problems to non-experts. Gamification is an effective tool for attracting citizen scientists to provide solutions to research problems. While citizen science games Foldit, EteRNA and EyeWire have been used successfully to study protein and RNA folding and neuron mapping, so far gamification has not been applied to problems in quantum physics. Does the fact that everyday experiences are based on classical physics hinder the use of non-expert citizen scientists in the realm of quantum mechanics? Here we report on Quantum Moves, an online platform gamifying optimization problems in quantum physics. We show that human players are able to find solutions to difficult problems associated with the task of quantum computing. Players succeed where purely numerical optimization fails, and analyses of their solutions provide insights into the problem of optimization of a more profound and general nature. Based on player strategies, we have thus developed a new, few-parameter heuristic optimization method which efficiently outperforms the most prominent established numerical methods. The numerical complexity associated with time-optimal solutions increases for shorter process durations. To better understand this, we have made a low-dimensional rendering of the optimization landscape. These studies show why traditional optimization methods fail near the quantum speed limit, and they bring promise that combined analyses of optimization landscapes and heuristic solution strategies may benefit wider classes of optimization problems in quantum physics and beyond.',\n",
       " \"The game Quantum Moves was designed to pit human players against computer algorithms, combining their solutions into hybrid optimization to control a scalable quantum computer. In this midstream report, we open our design process and describe the series of constitutive building stages going into a quantum physics citizen science game. We present our approach from designing a core gameplay around quantum simulations, to putting extra game elements in place in order to frame, structure, and motivate players' difficult path from curious visitors to competent science contributors. The player base is extremely diverse - for instance, two top players are a 40 year old female accountant and a male taxi driver. Among statistical predictors for retention and in-game high scores, the data from our first year suggest that people recruited based on real-world physics interest and via real-world events, but only with an intermediate science education, are more likely to become engaged and skilled contributors. Interestingly, female players tended to perform better than male players, even though men played more games per day. To understand this relationship, we explore the profiles of our top players in more depth. We discuss in-world and in-game performance factors departing in psychological theories of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, and the implications for using real live humans to do hybrid optimization via initially simple, but ultimately very cognitively complex games.\",\n",
       " 'We study the center structure of full dynamical QCD at finite temperatures and nonzero values of the background magnetic field using continuum extrapolated lattice data. We concentrate on two particular observables characterizing center clusters: their fractality and the probability for percolation. For temperatures below and around the transition region, the fractal dimension is found to be significantly smaller than three, leading to a vanishing mean free path inside the cluster structure. This finding might be relevant for center symmetry-based models of heavy-ion collisions. In addition, the percolation probability is employed to define the transition temperature and to map out the QCD phase diagram in the magnetic field-temperature plane.',\n",
       " 'Calculation of the log-normalizer is a major computational obstacle in applications of log-linear models with large output spaces. The problem of fast normalizer computation has therefore attracted significant attention in the theoretical and applied machine learning literature. In this paper, we analyze a recently proposed technique known as \"self-normalization\", which introduces a regularization term in training to penalize log normalizers for deviating from zero. This makes it possible to use unnormalized model scores as approximate probabilities. Empirical evidence suggests that self-normalization is extremely effective, but a theoretical understanding of why it should work, and how generally it can be applied, is largely lacking. We prove generalization bounds on the estimated variance of normalizers and upper bounds on the loss in accuracy due to self-normalization, describe classes of input distributions that self-normalize easily, and construct explicit examples of high-variance input distributions. Our theoretical results make predictions about the difficulty of fitting self-normalized models to several classes of distributions, and we conclude with empirical validation of these predictions.',\n",

We report here on searches through Auger data from 1 January 2004 until 20 June 2013. No neutrino candidates were found, yielding a limit to the diffuse flux of ultra-high energy neutrinos that challenges the Waxman-Bahcall bound predictions. Neutrino identification is attempted using the broad time-structure of the signals expected in the SD stations, and is efficiently done for neutrinos of all flavors interacting in the atmosphere at large zenith angles, as well as for \"Earth-skimming\" neutrino interactions in the case of tau neutrinos.

       " \"We measure the recent star formation history (SFH) across M31 using optical images taken with the \\\\texit{Hubble Space Telescope} as part of the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT). We fit the color-magnitude diagrams in ~9000 regions that are ~100 pc $\\\\times$ 100 pc in projected size, covering a 0.5 square degree area (~380 kpc$^2$, deprojected) in the NE quadrant of M31. We show that the SFHs vary significantly on these small spatial scales but that there are also coherent galaxy-wide fluctuations in the SFH back to ~500 Myr, most notably in M31's 10-kpc star-forming ring. We find that the 10-kpc ring is at least 400 Myr old, showing ongoing star formation over the past ~500 Myr. This indicates the presence of molecular gas in the ring over at least 2 dynamical times at this radius. We also find that the ring's position is constant throughout this time, and is stationary at the level of 1 km/s, although there is evidence for broadening of the ring due to diffusion of stars into the disk. Based on existing models of M31's ring features, the lack of evolution in the ring's position makes a purely collisional ring origin highly unlikely. We find that the global SFR has been fairly constant over the last ~500 Myr, though it does show a small increase at 50 Myr that is 1.3 times the average SFR over the past 100 Myr. During the last ~500 Myr, ~60% of all SF occurs in the 10-kpc ring.

We show that a new algorithm based on supervised learning in flexible probabilistic models outperforms all previously published techniques, setting a new standard for spike inference from calcium signals. Importantly, it performs better than other algorithms even on datasets not seen during training. Future data acquired in new experimental conditions can easily be used to further improve its spike prediction accuracy and generalization performance.

TESS has been selected by NASA for launch in 2017 as an Astrophysics Explorer mission. The spacecraft will be placed into a highly elliptical 13.7-day orbit around the Earth. During its two-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical CCD cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with I = 4-13 for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an interval ranging from one month to one year, depending mainly on the star's ecliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the ecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness measurements of preselected target stars will be recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded every 30 min. TESS stars will be 10-100 times brighter than those surveyed by the pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every four months, inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets.

       " 'Recent surveys have revealed that planets intermediate in size between Earth and Neptune (\"super-Earths\") are among the most common planets in the Galaxy. Atmospheric studies are the next step toward developing a comprehensive understanding of this new class of object. Much effort has been focused on using transmission spectroscopy to characterize the atmosphere of the super-Earth archetype GJ 1214b, but previous observations did not have sufficient precision to distinguish between two interpretations for the atmosphere. The planet\\'s atmosphere could be dominated by relatively heavy molecules, such as water (e.g., a 100% water vapor composition), or it could contain high-altitude clouds that obscure its lower layers. Here we report a measurement of the transmission spectrum of GJ 1214b at near-infrared wavelengths that definitively resolves this ambiguity. These data, obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, are sufficiently precise to detect absorption features from a high mean molecular mass atmosphere. The observed spectrum, however, is featureless. We rule out cloud-free atmospheric models with water-, methane-, carbon monoxide-, nitrogen-, or carbon dioxide-dominated compositions at greater than 5$σ$ confidence. The planet\\'s atmosphere must contain clouds to be consistent with the data.',\n",

The star is a new addition to the 10-pc census, with a parallax measured via the Research Consortium on Nearby Stars (RECONS) astrometric survey on the Small & Moderate Aperture Research Telescope System's (SMARTS) 0.9-m telescope. We demonstrate that the astrometry, radial velocity, and photometric data for LP 876-10 are consistent with the star being a third, bound, stellar component to the Fomalhaut multiple system, despite the star lying nearly 6 degrees away from Fomalhaut A in the sky. The 3D separation of LP 876-10 from Fomalhaut is only 0.77+-0.01 pc, and 0.987+-0.006 pc from TW PsA (Fomalhaut B), well within the estimated tidal radius of the Fomalhaut system (1.9 pc). LP 876-10 shares the motion of Fomalhaut within ~1 km/s, and we estimate an interloper probability of ~10^{-5}. Neither our echelle spectroscopy nor astrometry are able to confirm the close companion to LP 876-10 reported in the Washington Double Star Catalog (WSI 138). We argue that the Castor Moving Group to which the Fomalhaut system purportedly belongs, is likely to be a dynamical stream, and hence membership to the group does not provide useful age constraints for group members. LP 876-10 (Fomalhaut C) has now risen from obscurity to become a rare example of a field M dwarf with well-constrained age (440+-40 Myr) and metallicity.

       " 'Since the first report of a potentially non-solar carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) in its dayside atmosphere, the highly irradiated exoplanet WASP-12b has been under intense scrutiny and the subject of many follow-up observations. Additionally, the recent discovery of stellar binary companions ~1\" from WASP-12 has obfuscated interpretation of the observational data. Here we present new ground-based multi-object transmission-spectroscopy observations of WASP-12b that we acquired over two consecutive nights in the red optical with Gemini-N/GMOS. After correcting for the influence of WASP-12\\'s stellar companions, we find that these data rule out a cloud-free, H2 atmosphere with no additional opacity sources. We detect features in the transmission spectrum that may be attributed to metal oxides (such as TiO and VO) for an O-rich atmosphere or to metal hydrides (such as TiH) for a C-rich atmosphere. We also reanalyzed NIR transit-spectroscopy observations of WASP-12b from HST/WFC3 and broadband transit photometry from Warm Spitzer. We attribute the broad spectral features in the WFC3 data to either H2O or CH4 and HCN for an O-rich or C-rich atmosphere, respectively. The Spitzer data suggest shallower transit depths than the models predict at infrared wavelengths, albeit at low statistical significance. A multi-instrument, broad-wavelength analysis of WASP-12b suggests that the transmission spectrum is well approximated by a simple Rayleigh scattering model with a planet terminator temperature of 1870 +/- 130 K. We conclude that additional high-precision data and isolated spectroscopic measurements of the companion stars are required to place definitive constraints on the composition of WASP-12b\\'s atmosphere.',\n",

The observations were performed with the MMIRS instrument on the Magellan II telescope using the technique of multi-object spectroscopy with wide slits. We compare the transmission and emission data to theoretical models to constrain the composition and thermal structure of the planet's atmosphere. Our measured transmission spectrum exhibits a scatter that corresponds to 1.3 scale heights of the planet's atmosphere, which is consistent with the size of spectral features predicted by theoretical models for a clear atmosphere. We detected the secondary eclipses of the planet at significances ranging from 2.2 to 14.4 sigma. The secondary eclipse depths, and the significances of the detections increase towards longer wavelengths. Our measured emission spectrum is consistent with a 2250 K effectively isothermal 1-D model for the planet's dayside atmosphere. This model also matches previously published photometric measurements from the Spitzer Space Telescope and ground-based telescopes.

Finally, we introduce a new family of subclasses, the principled parametric context-free grammars (and a corresponding family of principled parametric context-sensitive grammars), which roughly model the \"Principles and Parameters\" framework in psycholinguistics. We present three hardness results: first, that the PPCFGs are not efficiently learnable given equivalence and membership oracles, second, that the PPCFGs are not efficiently learnable from positive presentations unless P = NP, and third, that the PPCSGs are not efficiently learnable from positive presentations unless integer factorization is in P.',\n",
       " 'Recently, several laser schemes have been proposed to separate racemic mixtures of enantiomers by splitting a molecular beam into subbeams consisting of molecules of definite chirality [Y.

However, the effect of molecular rotation has been neglected in these studies. Accounting for the full molecular quantum state we find that the potentials from the adiabatic dressed state approach cannot be recovered once the molecular orientation dynamics is included, even in the rotational ground state.

       " 'We calculate the thermal Casimir--Polder potential of C60 and C70 fullerene molecules near gold and silicon nitride surfaces, motivated by their relevance for molecular matter wave interference experiments. We obtain the coefficients governing the asymptotic power laws of the interaction in the thermal, retarded and nonretarded distance regimes and evaluate the full potential numerically. The interaction is found to be dominated by electronic transitions, and hence independent of the internal temperature of the molecules. The contributions from phonon transitions, which are affected by the molecular temperature, give rise to only a small correction. Moreover, we find that the sizeable molecular line widths of thermal fullerenes may modify the nonretarded interaction, depending on the model used. Detailed measurements of the nonretarded potential of fullerene thus allow one to distinguish between different theories of incorporating damping.',\n",
       " 'Theoretical models predict that some of the first stars ended their lives as extremely energetic pair-instability supernovae (PISNe). With energies approaching 10^53 ergs, these supernovae are expected to be within the detection limits of the upcoming James Webb Space telescope (JWST), allowing observational constraints to be placed on the properties of the first stars. We estimate the source density of PISNe using a semi-analytic halo mass function based approach, accounting for the effects of feedback from star formation on the PISN rates using cosmological simulations. We estimate an upper limit of ~0.2 PISNe per JWST field of view at any given time. Feedback can reduce this rate significantly, e.g., lowering it to as little as one PISN per 4000 JWST fields of view for the most pessimistic explosion models. We also find that the main obstacle to observing PISNe from the first stars is their scarcity, not their faintness; exposures longer than a few times 10^4s will do little to increase the number of PISNe found. Given this we suggest a mosaic style search strategy for detecting PISNe from the first stars. Even rather high redshift PISNe are unlikely to be missed by moderate exposures, and a large number of pointings will be required to ensure a detection.',\n",

Our K-band data are inconsistent with the detection of spectral features at these wavelengths reported by Croll and collaborators at the level of 4.1 sigma.

BOSS will measure redshifts of 1.5 million massive galaxies and Lya forest spectra of 150,000 quasars, using the BAO feature of large scale structure to obtain percent-level determinations of the distance scale and Hubble expansion rate at z<0.7 and at z~2.5. SEGUE-2, which is now completed, measured medium-resolution (R=1800) optical spectra of 118,000 stars in a variety of target categories, probing chemical evolution, stellar kinematics and substructure, and the mass profile of the dark matter halo from the solar neighborhood to distances of 100 kpc. APOGEE will obtain high-resolution (R~30,000), high signal-to-noise (S/N>100 per resolution element), H-band (1.51-1.70 micron) spectra of 10^5 evolved, late-type stars, measuring separate abundances for ~15 elements per star and creating the first high-precision spectroscopic survey of all Galactic stellar populations (bulge, bar, disks, halo) with a uniform set of stellar tracers and spectral diagnostics. MARVELS will monitor radial velocities of more than 8000 FGK stars with the sensitivity and cadence (10-40 m/s, ~24 visits per star) needed to detect giant planets with periods up to two years, providing an unprecedented data set for understanding the formation and dynamical evolution of giant planet systems.

       " '  We present high-precision relative radial velocities of the very low-mass star VB10 that were obtained over a time span of 0.61 yr as part of an ongoing search for planets around stars at the end of the main sequence. The radial velocities were measured from high-resolution near-infrared spectra obtained using the CRIRES instrument on the VLT with an ammonia gas cell. The typical internal precision of the measurements is 10 m/s. These data do not exhibit significant variability and are essentially constant at a level consistent with the measurement uncertainties. Therefore, we do not detect the radial velocity variations of VB10 expected due to the presence of an orbiting giant planet similar to that recently proposed by Pravdo and Shaklan based on apparent astrometric perturbations. In addition, we do not confirm the ~1 km/s radial velocity variability of the star tentatively detected by Zapatero Osorio and colleagues with lower precision measurements. Our measurements rule out planets with M_p > 3 M_Jup and the orbital period and inclination suggested by Pravdo and Shaklan at better than 5 sigma confidence. We conclude that the planet detection claimed by Pravdo and Shaklan is spurious on the basis of this result. Although the outcome of this work is a non-detection, it illustrates the potential of using ammonia cell radial velocities to detect planets around very low-mass stars.',\n",
       " '  Radial velocities measured from near-infrared spectra are a potentially powerful tool to search for planets around cool stars and sub-stellar objects. However, no technique currently exists that yields near-infrared radial velocity precision comparable to that routinely obtained in the visible. We describe a method for measuring high-precision relative radial velocities of these stars from K-band spectra. The method makes use of a glass cell filled with ammonia gas to calibrate the spectrograph response similar to the \"iodine cell\" technique that has been used very successfully in the visible. Stellar spectra are obtained through the ammonia cell and modeled as the product of a Doppler-shifted template spectrum of the object and a spectrum of the cell, convolved with a variable instrumental profile model. A complicating factor is that a significant number of telluric absorption lines are present in the spectral regions containing useful stellar and ammonia lines. The telluric lines are modeled simultaneously as well using spectrum synthesis with a time-resolved model of the atmosphere over the observatory. The free parameters in the complete model are the wavelength scale of the spectrum, the instrumental profile, adjustments to the water and methane abundances in the atmospheric model, telluric spectrum Doppler shift, and stellar Doppler shift. Tests of the method based on the analysis of hundreds of spectra obtained for late M dwarfs over six months demonstrate that precisions of ~5 m/s are obtainable over long timescales, and precisions of better than 3 m/s can be obtained over timescales up to a week. The obtained precision is comparable to the predicted photon-limited errors, but primarily limited over long timescales by the imperfect modeling of the telluric lines.',\n",
       " \"  We present a combined analysis of previously published high-precision radial velocities and astrometry for the GJ876 planetary system using a self-consistent model that accounts for the planet-planet interactions. Assuming the three planets so far identified in the system are coplanar, we find that including the astrometry in the analysis does not result in a best-fit inclination significantly different than that found by Rivera and collaborators from analyzing the radial velocities alone. In this unique case, the planet-planet interactions are of such significance that the radial velocity data set is more sensitive to the inclination of the system through the dependence of the interactions on the true masses of the two gas giant planets in the system (planets b and c). The astrometry does allow determination of the absolute orbital inclination (i.e. distinguishing between i and 180-i) and longitude of the ascending node for planet b, which allows us to quantify the mutual inclination angle between its orbit and planet c's orbit when combined with the dynamical considerations. We find that the planets have a mutual inclination of 5.0 +3.9 -2.3 degrees. This result constitutes the first determination of the degree of coplanarity in an exoplanetary system around a normal star. That we find the two planets' orbits are nearly coplanar, like the orbits of the Solar System planets, indicates that the planets likely formed in a circumstellar disk, and that their subsequent dynamical evolution into a 2:1 mean motion resonance only led to excitation of a small mutual inclination. This investigation demonstrates how the degree of coplanarity for other exoplanetary systems could also be established using data obtained from existing facilities.\",\n",
       " \"  Ribas and collaborators have recently proposed that an additional, ~5 M_earth planet orbits the transiting planet host star GJ436. Long-term dynamical interactions between the two planets leading to eccentricity excitation might provide an explanation for the transiting planet's unexpectedly large orbital eccentricity. In this paper we examine whether the existence of such a second planet is supported by the available observational data when the short-term interactions that would result from its presence are accounted for. We find that the model for the system suggested by Ribas and collaborators lead to predictions that are strongly inconsistent with the measured host star radial velocities, transiting planet primary and secondary eclipse times, and transiting planet orbital inclinations. A search for an alternative two planet model that is consistent with the data yields a number of plausible solutions, although no single one stands out as particularly unique by giving a significantly better fit to the data than the nominal single planet model. We conclude from this study that Ribas and collaborator's general hypothesis of an additional short-period planet in the GJ436 system is still plausible, but that there is not sufficient evidence to support their claim of a planet detection.\",\n",

The potential is produced by a relatively simple laser configuration for atoms with a tripod level scheme. We show that the atomic motion is described by two different dispersion branches with positive or negative chirality. As a consequence of that, atom reflection shows unusual features, since an incident wave may split into two reflected ones at a barrier, an ordinary specular reflection, and an additional non-specular one. Remarkably, the latter wave can exhibit negative reflection and may become evanescent if the angle of incidence exceeds a critical value. These reflection properties are crucial for future designs in non-Abelian atom optics.',\n",

An analysis of his proof reveals a convexity structure for ascending lines in R^d that is isomorphic to the ordinary notion of convexity in a convex subset of R^{2d-2}. This isomorphism is through a Cremona transformation on the Grassmannian of lines in P^d, which enables a precise description of the convex hull and affine span of up to d ascending lines: the lines in such an affine span turn out to be the rulings of certain classical determinantal varieties. Finally, we relate Cremona convexity to a new convexity structure that we call frame convexity, which extends to arbitrary-dimensional flats.',\n",

The data allow the measurement of a time delay of 146 +- 8 days (2 sigma) between A and B, with B as the leading component. This value is significantly shorter than that predicted from simple models and indicates a very large external shear.

       " '  We use the recently proposed supergravity approach to large $N$ gauge theories to calculate ordinary and spatial Wilson loops of gauge theories in various dimensions. In this framework we observe an area law for spatial Wilson loops in four and five dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills at finite temperature. This can be interpreted as the area law of ordinary Wilson loops in three and four dimensional non-supersymmetric gauge theories at zero temperature which indicates confinement in these theories. Furthermore, we show that super Yang Mills theories with 16 supersymmetries at finite temperature do not admit phase transitions between the weakly coupled super Yang Mills and supergravity regimes. This result is derived by analyzing the entropy and specific heat of those systems as well as by computing ordinary Wilson loops at finite temperature. The calculation of the entropy was carried out in all different regimes and indicates that there is no first order phase transition in these systems. For the same theories at zero temperature we also compute the dependence of the quark anti-quark potential on the separating distance.',\n",
       " 'We present a compact model for Tunnel Field Effect Transistors (TFET), that captures sev- eral non-idealities such as the Trap Assisted Tunneling (TAT) originating from interface traps (Dit), along with Verilog-A implementation. We show that the TAT, together with band edge non-abruptness known as the Urbach tail, sets the lower limit of the sub-threshold swing and the minimum achievable current at a given temperature. Presence of charged trap states also contributes to reduced gate efficiency. We show that we can decouple the contribution of each of these processes and extract the intrinsic sub-threshold swing from a given experimental data. We derive closed form expressions of channel potential, electric field and effective tunnel energy window to accurately capture the essential device physics of TFETs. We test the model against recently published exper- imental data, and simulate simple TFET circuits using the Verilog-A model. The compact model provides a framework for TFET technology projections with improved device metrics such as better electrostatic design, reduced TAT, material with better transport properties etc.',\n",
       " 'We provide a detailed study of the interface Trap Assisted Tunneling (TAT) mechanism in tunnel field effect transistors to show how it contributes a major leakage current path before the Band To Band Tunneling (BTBT) is initiated. With a modified Shockley-Read-Hall formalism, we show that at room temperature, the phonon assisted TAT current always dominates and obscures the steep turn ON of the BTBT current for common densities of traps. Our results are applicable to top gate, double gate and gate all around structures where the traps are positioned between the source-channel tunneling region. Since the TAT has strong dependence on electric field, any effort to increase the BTBT current by enhancing local electric field also increases the leakage current. Unless the BTBT current can be increased separately, calculations show that the trap density Dit has to be decreased by 40-100 times compared with the state of the art in order for the steep turn ON (for III-V materials) to be clearly observable at room temperature. We find that the combination of the intrinsic sharpness of the band edges (Urbach tail) and the surface trap density determines the subthreshold swing.',\n",
       " 'With rapid advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, electrical devices in the near future is expected to have IoT capabilities. This enables fine-grained tracking of individual energy consumption data of such devices, offering location-independent per-device billing. Thus, it is more fine-grained than the location-based metering of state-of-the-art infrastructure, which traditionally aggregates on a building or household level, defining the entity to be billed. However, such in-device energy metering is susceptible to manipulation and fraud. As a remedy, we propose a decentralized metering architecture that enables devices with IoT capabilities to measure their own energy consumption. In this architecture, the device-level consumption is additionally reported to a system-level aggregator that verifies distributed information and provides secure data storage using Blockchain, preventing data manipulation by untrusted entities. Using evaluations on an experimental testbed, we show that the proposed architecture supports device mobility and enables location-independent monitoring of energy consumption.',\n",

The cloud and edge platform is very crucial to these applications due to their inherent compute-intensive and resource-constrained nature. One of the foremost challenges in cloud and edge resource allocation is the efficient management of computation and communication resources to meet the performance and latency guarantees of the applications. The heterogeneity of cloud resources (processors, memory, storage, bandwidth), variable cost structure and unpredictable workload patterns make the design of resource allocation techniques complex. Numerous research studies have been carried out to address this intricate problem. In this paper, the current state-of-the-art resource allocation techniques for the cloud continuum, in particular those that consider time-sensitive applications, are reviewed. Furthermore, we present the key challenges in the resource allocation problem for the cloud continuum, a taxonomy to classify the existing literature and the potential research gaps.\",\n",
       " 'Maintaining peer-to-peer connectivity with low energy overhead is a key requirement for several emerging Internet of Things (IoT) applications. It is also desirable to develop such connectivity solutions for non-static network topologies, so that resilience to device failures can be fully realized. Decentralized clustering has emerged as a promising technique to address this critical challenge. Clustering of nodes around cluster heads (CHs) provides an energy-efficient two-tier framework for peer-to-peer communication. At the same time, decentralization ensures that the framework can quickly adapt to a dynamically changing network topology. Although some decentralized clustering solutions have been proposed in the literature, they either lack guarantees on connectivity or incur significant energy overhead to maintain the clusters. In this paper, we present Decentralized Connected Resilient IoT Clustering (DeCoRIC), an energy-efficient clustering scheme that is self-organizing and resilient to network changes while guaranteeing connectivity. Using experiments implemented on the Contiki simulator, we show that our clustering scheme adapts itself to node faults in a time-bound manner. Our experiments show that DeCoRIC achieves 100% connectivity among all nodes while improving the power efficiency of nodes in the system compared to the state-of-the-art techniques BEEM and LEACH by up to 110% and 70%, respectively. The improved power efficiency also translates to longer lifetime before first node death with a best-case of 109% longer than BEEM and 42% longer than LEACH.',\n",

However, there presently exists no consensus on which decoding procedure is best or even the criteria by which to compare them. We address these issues by casting decoding as a multi-objective optimization problem aiming to simultaneously maximize both response quality and diversity. Our framework enables us to perform the first large-scale evaluation of decoding methods along the entire quality-diversity spectrum. We find that when diversity is a priority, all methods perform similarly, but when quality is viewed as more important, the recently proposed nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al. 2019) outperforms all other evaluated decoding algorithms. Our experiments also confirm the existence of the `likelihood trap', the counter-intuitive observation that high likelihood sequences are often surprisingly low quality.

Object-based biases relate to things like size, context, or diversity of object representation in the dataset; gender-based metrics aim to reveal the stereotypical portrayal of people of different genders within the dataset, with future iterations of our tool extending the analysis to additional axes of identity; geography-based analysis considers the representation of different geographic locations. Our tool is designed to shed light on the dataset along these three axes, allowing both dataset creators and users to gain a better understanding of what exactly is portrayed in their dataset.

In this paper, we propose a contract-based fault-resilient methodology which aims at managing the communication delays of real-time flows in industries. With this objective, we present a light-weight mechanism to estimate end-to-end delay in the network in which the clocks of the switches are not synchronized. The mechanism aims at providing high level of accuracy with lower communication overhead.

How to reduce the downtime and locate the failures becomes a core issue in system design. In this paper, we employ a hierarchical contract-based resilience framework to guarantee the stability of CPS. In this framework, we use Assume Guarantee (A-G) contracts to monitor the non-functional properties of individual components (e.g., power and latency), and hierarchically compose such contracts to deduce information about faults at the system level. The hierarchical contracts enable rapid fault detection in large-scale CPS. However, due to the vast number of components in CPS, manually designing numerous contracts and the hierarchy becomes challenging. To address this issue, we propose a technique to automatically decompose a root contract into multiple lower-level contracts depending on I/O dependencies between components. We then formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to search the optimal parameters of each lower-level contract. This enables automatic contract refinement taking into consideration the communication overhead between components.

At low temperature, the magnetic field dependence of the magnetoresistance shows a transition from logarithmic to linear behavior and the onset magnetic field value for this transition decreases with increasing temperature. The logarithmic magnetoresistance indicates the anti-localization of the surface Dirac electrons while the high temperature behavior originates from the bulk carriers due to intrinsic impurities.

       " 'Scheduling of constrained deadline sporadic task systems on multiprocessor platforms is an area which has received much attention in the recent past. It is widely believed that finding an optimal scheduler is hard, and therefore most studies have focused on developing algorithms with good processor utilization bounds. These algorithms can be broadly classified into two categories: partitioned scheduling in which tasks are statically assigned to individual processors, and global scheduling in which each task is allowed to execute on any processor in the platform. In this paper we consider a third, more general, approach called cluster-based scheduling. In this approach each task is statically assigned to a processor cluster, tasks in each cluster are globally scheduled among themselves, and clusters in turn are scheduled on the multiprocessor platform. We develop techniques to support such cluster-based scheduling algorithms, and also consider properties that minimize total processor utilization of individual clusters. In the last part of this paper, we develop new virtual cluster-based scheduling algorithms. For implicit deadline sporadic task systems, we develop an optimal scheduling algorithm that is neither Pfair nor ERfair. We also show that the processor utilization bound of US-EDF{m/(2m-1)} can be improved by using virtual clustering. Since neither partitioned nor global strategies dominate over the other, cluster-based scheduling is a natural direction for research towards achieving improved processor utilization bounds.',\n",

As a consequence, they under-utilize resources by penalizing all the low-criticality applications. In this paper we overcome this shortcoming using a novel mechanism that comprises a parameter to model the expected number of critical applications simultaneously demanding more resources, and an execution strategy based on the parameter to improve resource utilization. Since most mixed-criticality systems in practice are component-based, we design our mechanism such that the component boundaries provide the isolation necessary to support the execution of low-criticality applications, and at the same time protect the critical ones. We also develop schedulability tests for the proposed mechanism under both a flat as well as a hierarchical scheduling framework. Finally, through simulations, we compare the performance of the proposed approach with existing studies in terms of schedulability and the capability to support low-criticality applications.',\n",

The quark and gluon condensates of the nuclear medium at finite magnetic field, temperature, isospin asymmetry, and density have been obtained by the meson exchange scalar fields within the chiral SU(3) model. The medium attributes modify the scalar and vector density of nuclear medium and this variation reflects in the in-medium mass and decay constant of spin 1 $D$ mesons. We calculate these observables by comparing the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) and the phenomenological side in the QCD Sum Rules. In the results, we observed a positive mass shift for charged vector and axial-vector $D$ mesons with respect to magnetic field. For neutral vector (axial-vector) $D$ mesons we observed negative (positive) mass shift as a function of magnetic field. In the application part, we calculate the in-medium partial decay width of the process $D^*_s$(2715/2860) $\\\\rightarrow$ $D^* K$ by using $^3P_0$ model. The in-medium effects are incorporated through the in-medium masses of $D^*$ and $K$ mesons.',\n",
       " 'Quantum discord is a measure based on local projective measurements which captures quantum correlations that go beyond entanglement. A change in the measurement process, achieved by replacing rank-one projectors with a weak positive operator-valued measure (POVM), allows one to define a quantity termed as weak quantum discord. In this work, we experimentally simulate the effect of a weak POVM on a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum information processor. The two-qubit system under investigation is part of a three-qubit system, where one of the qubits is used as an ancillary to implement the phase damping channel. The strength of the weak POVM is controlled by varying the strength of the phase damping channel. We experimentally observed weak discord in two-qubit states and computed a cost function whose purpose is to optimally extract correlations representing the difference between weak and strong quantum discord. The resultant dynamics of the states is investigated as a function of the measurement strength.',\n",

We consider all possible vector LQ models within the Buchmüller-Rückl-Wyler classifications with the desired decay. We propose simple phenomenological Lagrangians that are suitable for bottom-up/experimental studies and, at the same time, can cover the relevant parameter spaces of these models. In this simplified framework, we study the pair and single production channels of vector LQs at the LHC. Interestingly, we find that, like the pair production, the cross sections of some single production processes also depend on the parameter $κ$ that appears in the gluon-vector LQ coupling. We adopt a search strategy of selecting events with at least one boosted hadronic top quark and exactly two high-$p_{\\\\rm T}$ leptons of the same flavor and opposite sign. This combines events from the pair and single production processes and, therefore, can enhance the discovery potential than that of the pair-production-only searches. For $5σ$ discovery we find that vector LQs can be probed up to 2.55 TeV for $100\\\\%$ branching ratio in the $t\\\\ell $ decay mode and $\\\\mathcal{O}(1)$ new couplings at the 14 TeV LHC with 3 ab$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity.',\n",

Standard protocols for quantum state and quantum process tomography are based on linear inversion, which often result in an unphysical density matrix and hence an invalid process matrix. The CCO method on the other hand, produces physically valid density matrices and process matrices, with significantly improved fidelity as compared to the standard methods. The constrainedoptimization problem is solved with the help of a semi-definite programming (SDP) protocol. We use the CCO method to estimate the Kraus operators and characterize gates in the presence of errors due to decoherence. We then assume Markovian system dynamics and use a Lindblad master equation in conjunction with the CCO method to completely characterize the noise processes present in the NMR qubits.',\n",

However, the computational cost of the ERA is dominated by a step that involves the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a large, dense matrix with block Hankel structure. This paper develops computationally efficient algorithms for reducing the computational cost of the SVD step by using randomized subspace iteration and exploiting the block Hankel structure of the matrix. We provide a detailed analysis of the error in the identified system matrices and the computational cost of the proposed algorithms. We demonstrate the accuracy and computational benefits of our algorithms on two test problems: the first involves a partial differential equation that models the cooling of steel rails, and the second is an application from power systems engineering.',\n",
       " 'We report the detection of a Saturn-size exoplanet orbiting HD 332231 (TOI 1456) in light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). HD 332231, an F8 dwarf star with a V-band magnitude of 8.56, was observed by TESS in Sectors 14 and 15. We detect a single-transit event in the Sector 15 presearch data conditioning (PDC) light curve. We obtain spectroscopic follow-up observations of HD 332231 with the Automated Planet Finder, Keck I, and SONG telescopes. The orbital period we infer from the radial velocity (RV) observations leads to the discovery of another transit in Sector 14 that was masked by PDC due to scattered light contamination. A joint analysis of the transit and RV data confirms the planetary nature of HD 332231 b, a Saturn-size ($0.867^{+0.027}_{-0.025} \\\\; R_{\\\\rm J}$), sub-Saturn-mass ($0.244\\\\pm0.021 \\\\; M_{\\\\rm J}$) exoplanet on a 18.71 day circular orbit. The low surface gravity of HD 332231 b and the relatively low stellar flux it receives make it a compelling target for transmission spectroscopy. Also, the stellar obliquity is likely measurable via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, an exciting prospect given the 0.14 au orbital separation of HD 332231 b. The spectroscopic observations do not provide substantial evidence for any additional planets in the HD 332231 system, but continued RV monitoring is needed to further characterize this system. We also predict that the frequency and duration of masked data in the PDC light curves for TESS Sectors 14-16 could hide transits of some exoplanets with orbital periods between 10.5 and 17.5 days.',\n",
       " 'Digital twin is a virtual replica of a real-world object that lives simultaneously with its physical counterpart. Since its first introduction in 2003 by Grieves, digital twin has gained momentum in a wide range of applications such as industrial manufacturing, automotive and artificial intelligence. However, many digital-twin-related approaches, found in industries as well as literature, mainly focus on modelling individual physical things with high-fidelity methods with limited scalability. In this paper, we introduce a digital-twin architecture called TiLA (Twin-in-the-Loop Architecture). TiLA employs heterogeneous models and online data to create a digital twin, which follows a Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous (GALS) model of computation. It facilitates the creation of a scalable digital twin with different levels of modelling abstraction as well as giving GALS formalism for execution strategy. Furthermore, TiLA provides facilities to develop applications around the twin as well as an interface to synchronise the twin with the physical system through an industrial communication protocol. A digital twin for a manufacturing line has been developed as a case study using TiLA. It demonstrates the use of digital twin models together with online data for monitoring and analysing failures in the physical system.',\n",
       " 'Learning Enabled Components (LECs) are widely being used in a variety of perception based autonomy tasks like image segmentation, object detection, end-to-end driving, etc. These components are trained with large image datasets with multimodal factors like weather conditions, time-of-day, traffic-density, etc. The LECs learn from these factors during training, and while testing if there is variation in any of these factors, the components get confused resulting in low confidence predictions. The images with factors not seen during training is commonly referred to as Out-of-Distribution (OOD). For safe autonomy it is important to identify the OOD images, so that a suitable mitigation strategy can be performed. Classical one-class classifiers like SVM and SVDD are used to perform OOD detection. However, the multiple labels attached to the images in these datasets, restricts the direct application of these techniques. We address this problem using the latent space of the $β$-Variational Autoencoder ($β$-VAE). We use the fact that compact latent space generated by an appropriately selected $β$-VAE will encode the information about these factors in a few latent variables, and that can be used for computationally inexpensive detection. We evaluate our approach on the nuScenes dataset, and our results shows the latent space of $β$-VAE is sensitive to encode changes in the values of the generative factor.',\n",
       " 'Many existing studies on mixed-criticality (MC) scheduling assume that low-criticality budgets for high-criticality applications are known apriori. These budgets are primarily used as guidance to determine when the scheduler should switch the system mode from low to high. Based on this key observation, in this paper we propose a dynamic MC scheduling model under which low-criticality budgets for individual high-criticality applications are determined at runtime as opposed to being fixed offline. To ensure sufficient budget for high-criticality applications at all times, we use offline schedulability analysis to determine a system-wide total low-criticality budget allocation for all the high-criticality applications combined. This total budget is used as guidance in our model to determine the need for a mode-switch. The runtime strategy then distributes this total budget among the various applications depending on their execution requirement and with the objective of postponing mode-switch as much as possible. We show that this runtime strategy is able to postpone mode-switches for a longer time than any strategy that uses a fixed low-criticality budget allocation for each application. Finally, since we are able to control the total budget allocation for high-criticality applications before mode-switch, we also propose techniques to determine these budgets considering system-wide objectives such as schedulability and service guarantee for low-criticality applications.',\n",

It has also been reported that these interactions are of many-body nature. While previous understanding of these interactions is based on experimental inferences from past experiments, through these calculations, for the first time, we can understand the nature of the interactions at a fundamental level. In this work, we use Density Functional Theory calculations to study the interactions of interstitial hydrogen atoms in niobium. We report here that these interactions are a combination of an attractive, indirect image interaction and a repulsive, direct interaction. Through our calculations, we also infer here that these interactions indeed have many-body characteristics.',\n",
       " 'Mixed-Criticality (MC) systems consolidate multiple functionalities with different criticalities onto a single hardware platform. Such systems improve the overall resource utilization while guaranteeing resources to critical tasks. In this paper, we focus on the problem of partitioned multiprocessor MC scheduling, in particular the problem of designing efficient partitioning strategies. We develop two new partitioning strategies based on the principle of evenly distributing the difference between total high-critical utilization and total low-critical utilization for the critical tasks among all processors. By balancing this difference, we are able to reduce the pessimism in uniprocessor MC schedulability tests that are applied on each processor, thus improving overall schedulability. To evaluate the schedulability performance of the proposed strategies, we compare them against existing partitioned algorithms using extensive experiments. We show that the proposed strategies are effective with both dynamic-priority Earliest Deadline First with Virtual Deadlines (EDF-VD) and fixed-priority Adaptive Mixed-Criticality (AMC) algorithms. Specifically, our results show that the proposed strategies improve schedulability by as much as 28.1% and 36.2% for implicit and constrained-deadline task systems respectively.',\n",

Although efficient scheduling algorithms have been developed for implicit deadline task systems, the same is not true for more general sporadic tasks. In this paper we develop a new demand-based schedulability test for such general mixed-criticality task systems, in which we collectively bound the low- and high-criticality demand of tasks. We show that the new test strictly dominates the only other known demand-based test for such systems.

       " 'Different scheduling algorithms for mixed criticality systems have been recently proposed. The common denominator of these algorithms is to discard low critical tasks whenever high critical tasks are in lack of computation resources. This is achieved upon a switch of the scheduling mode from Normal to Critical. We distinguish two main categories of the algorithms: system-level mode switch and task-level mode switch. System-level mode algorithms allow low criticality (LC) tasks to execute only in normal mode. Task-level mode switch algorithms enable to switch the mode of an individual high criticality task (HC), from low (LO) to high (HI), to obtain priority over all LC tasks. This paper investigates an online scheduling algorithm for mixed-criticality systems that supports dynamic mode switches for both task level and system level. When a HC task job overruns its LC budget, then only that particular job is switched to HI mode. If the job cannot be accommodated, then the system switches to Critical mode. To accommodate for resource availability of the HC jobs, the LC tasks are degraded by stretching their periods until the Critical mode exhibiting job complete its execution. The stretching will be carried out until the resource availability is met. We have mechanized and implemented the proposed algorithm using Uppaal. To study the efficiency of our scheduling algorithm, we examine a case study and compare our results to the state of the art algorithms.',\n",
       " 'In this paper we consider the problem of mixed-criticality (MC) scheduling of implicit-deadline sporadic task systems on a homogenous multiprocessor platform. Focusing on dual-criticality systems, algorithms based on the fluid scheduling model have been proposed in the past. These algorithms use a dual-rate execution model for each high-criticality task depending on the system mode. Once the system switches to the high-criticality mode, the execution rates of such tasks are increased to meet their increased demand. Although these algorithms are speed-up optimal, they are unable to schedule several feasible dual-criticality task systems. This is because a single fixed execution rate for each high-criticality task after the mode switch is not efficient to handle the high variability in demand during the transition period immediately following the mode switch. This demand variability exists as long as the carry-over jobs of high-criticality tasks, that is jobs released before the mode switch, have not completed. Addressing this shortcoming, we propose a multi-rate fluid execution model for dual-criticality task systems in this paper. Under this model, high-criticality tasks are allocated varying execution rates in the transition period after the mode switch to efficiently handle the demand variability. We derive a sufficient schedulability test for the proposed model and show its dominance over the dual-rate fluid execution model. Further, we also present a speed-up optimal rate assignment strategy for the multi-rate model, and experimentally show that the proposed model outperforms all the existing MC scheduling algorithms with known speed-up bounds.',\n",

In such a system, there are typically different applications providing functionalities that have varying degrees of criticality. Consequently, the certification requirements for functionalities at these different criticality levels are also varying, with very high levels of assurance required for a highly critical functionality, whereas relatively low levels of assurance required for a less critical functionality. Considering the timing assurance given to various applications in the form of guaranteed budgets within deadlines, a theory of real-time scheduling for such multi-criticality systems has been under development in the recent past. In particular, an algorithm called Earliest Deadline First with Virtual Deadlines (EDF-VD) has shown a lot of promise for systems with two criticality levels, especially in terms of practical performance demonstrated through experiment results. In this paper we design a new schedulability test for EDF-VD that extend these performance benefits to multi-criticality systems. We propose a new test based on demand bound functions and also present a novel virtual deadline assignment strategy. Through extensive experiments we show that the proposed technique significantly outperforms existing strategies for a variety of generic real-time systems.',\n",
       " \"SREC markets are a market-based system designed to incentivize solar energy generation. A regulatory body imposes a lower bound on the amount of energy each regulated firm must generate via solar means, providing them with a certificate for each MWh generated. Regulated firms seek to navigate the market to minimize the cost imposed on them, by modulating their SREC generation and trading activities. As such, the SREC market can be viewed through the lens of a large stochastic game with heterogeneous agents, where agents interact through the market price of the certificates. We study this stochastic game by solving the mean-field game (MFG) limit with sub-populations of heterogeneous agents. Our market participants optimize costs accounting for trading frictions, cost of generation, SREC penalty, and generation uncertainty. Using techniques from variational analysis, we characterize firms' optimal controls as the solution of a new class of McKean-Vlasov FBSDE and determine the equilibrium SREC price. We further prove that MFG strategy has the $ε$-Nash property for the finite player game. Finally, we numerically solve the MV-FBSDEs and conclude by demonstrating how firms behave in equilibrium using simulated examples.\",\n",
       " 'This paper presents a novel solution technique for scheduling multi-energy system (MES) in a commercial urban building to perform price-based demand response and reduce energy costs. The MES scheduling problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP), a non-convex NPhard problem with uncertainties due to renewable generation and demand. A model predictive control approach is used to handle the uncertainties and price variations. This in-turn requires solving a time-coupled multi-time step MINLP during each time-epoch which is computationally intensive. This investigation proposes an approach called the Scenario-Based Branch-and-Bound (SB3), a light-weight solver to reduce the computational complexity. It combines the simplicity of convex programs with the ability of meta-heuristic techniques to handle complex nonlinear problems. The performance of the SB3 solver is validated in the Cleantech building, Singapore and the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reduces energy cost by about 17.26% and 22.46% as against solving a multi-time step heuristic optimization model.',\n",

The proposed technique is based on laser-interference-induced dewetting. A precise control of the laser pulse energy enables the fabrication of ordered dielectric metasurfaces in areas spanning tens of micrometers and consisting of thousands of hemispherical nanoparticles with a single laser shot. The fabricated nanoparticles exhibit a wavelength-dependent optical response with a strong electric dipole signature. Variation of the pre-deposited silicon film thickness allows tailoring of the resonances in the targeted visible and infrared spectral ranges.

       " 'The Standard Model (SM) when extended with a Leptoquark (LQ) and right handed neutrinos, can have interesting new implications for Higgs physics. We show that the sterile neutrinos can induce a significant boost to the down-type quark Yukawa interactions through a diagonal coupling associated with the quarks and a scalar LQ of electromagnetic charge $1/3$. The relative change is much more pronounced in case of the first two generations of quarks as they have vanishingly small Yukawa couplings in the SM. The enhancement in the couplings would also lead to a non-negligible contribution of the quark fusion process to the production of the 125 GeV Higgs scalar in the SM, though the gluon fusion always dominates. However, this may not be true for a general scalar. As an example, we consider a scenario with a SM-gauge-singlet scalar $φ$ where an $\\\\mathcal O(1)$ coupling between $φ$ and the LQ is allowed. The $φq \\\\bar{q}$ Yukawa couplings can only be generated radiatively through a loop of LQ and sterile neutrinos. Here, the quark fusion process can have significant cross section, specially for a light $φ$. It can even supersede the normally dominant gluon fusion process for a moderate to large value of the LQ mass. This model can be tested/constrained at the high luminosity run of the LHC through a potentially large branching fraction of the scalar to two-jets.',\n",

Similarly, we identify another class of states which show Bell violation but can not be used for generating secure key even after local filtering. The existence of these two classes of states demonstrates that Bell violation as an initial resource is neither necessary nor sufficient for QKD. Our work therefore forces a departure from traditional thinking that the degree of Bell violation is a key resource for quantum communication and brings out the role of local filtering.',\n",

As a consequence, viscous SIDM can explain the low redshift observations and also consistent with the standard cosmological prediction.',\n",

We investigate the interplay between lattice conformation and bidirectional transport by obtaining the stationary phase diagrams and density profiles within the framework of mean field theory. For the case when recycling strength is independent of density of particles, the topology of phase diagram alters quantitatively.

       " 'Talek is a private group messaging system that sends messages through potentially untrustworthy servers, while hiding both data content and the communication patterns among its users. Talek explores a new point in the design space of private messaging; it guarantees access sequence indistinguishability, which is among the strongest guarantees in the space, while assuming an anytrust threat model, which is only slightly weaker than the strongest threat model currently found in related work. Our results suggest that this is a pragmatic point in the design space, since it supports strong privacy and good performance: we demonstrate a 3-server Talek cluster that achieves throughput of 9,433 messages/second for 32,000 active users with 1.7-second end-to-end latency. To achieve its security goals without coordination between clients, Talek relies on information-theoretic private information retrieval. To achieve good performance and minimize server-side storage, Talek introduces new techniques and optimizations that may be of independent interest, e.g., a novel use of blocked cuckoo hashing and support for private notifications. The latter provide a private, efficient mechanism for users to learn, without polling, which logs have new messages.',\n",
       " 'The goal of this paper is to present a method for simultaneous trajectory and local stabilizing policy optimization to generate local policies for trajectory-centric model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL). This is motivated by the fact that global policy optimization for non-linear systems could be a very challenging problem both algorithmically and numerically. However, a lot of robotic manipulation tasks are trajectory-centric, and thus do not require a global model or policy. Due to inaccuracies in the learned model estimates, an open-loop trajectory optimization process mostly results in very poor performance when used on the real system. Motivated by these problems, we try to formulate the problem of trajectory optimization and local policy synthesis as a single optimization problem. It is then solved simultaneously as an instance of nonlinear programming. We provide some results for analysis as well as achieved performance of the proposed technique under some simplifying assumptions.',\n",

Abu India, commissioned in February 2019. Here we present the first science results derived from the low resolution spectroscopy program of a sample of M Dwarfs carried out during the commissioning run of MFOSC-P between February-June 2019. M dwarfs carry great significance for exoplanets searches in habitable zone and are among the promising candidates for the observatory's several ongoing observational campaigns. Determination of their accurate atmospheric properties and fundamental parameters is essential to constrain both their atmospheric and evolutionary models. In this study, we provide a low resolution (R$\\\\sim$500) spectroscopic catalogue of 80 bright M dwarfs (J$<$10) and classify them using their optical spectra. We have also performed the spectral synthesis and $χ^2$ minimisation techniques to determine their fundamental parameters viz. effective temperature and surface gravity by comparing the observed spectra with the most recent BT-Settl synthetic spectra. Spectral type of M dwarfs in our sample ranges from M0 to M5. The derived effective temperature and surface gravity are ranging from 4000 K to 3000 K and 4.5 to 5.5 dex, respectively. In most of the cases, the derived spectral types are in good agreement with previously assigned photometric classification.\",\n",

We lower bound the capacity of such a channel using a dynamic programming formulation of a bound on the maximum reverse directed information rate. We show that the dynamic programming-based bounds can be simplified by solving the corresponding Bellman equation explicitly. In particular, we provide analytical lower bounds on the capacities of $(d, k)$-runlength-limited input-constrained binary symmetric and binary erasure channels. Furthermore, we provide a single-letter lower bound based on a class of input distributions with memory.',\n",
       " 'We consider an exclusion process on a periodic one-dimensional lattice where all particles perform simple symmetric exclusion at rate $1$ except for a single tracer particle, which performs partially simple asymmetric exclusion with rate $p$ to the right and rate $q$ to the left. This model was first considered by Ferrari, Goldstein and Lebowitz (Progr. Phys., 1985) as a test for the validity of the Einstein relation in microscopic systems.\\n  The main thrust of this work is an exact solution for the steady state of this exclusion process. We show that the stationary probabilities factorize and give an exact formula for the nonequilibrium partition function. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that the nonequilibrium free energy in the steady state is not well-defined for this system in the thermodynamic limit for any values of $p$ and $q$ if $p \\\\neq q$. We provide formulas for the current and two-point correlations. When the tracer particle performs asymmetric exclusion ($q=0$), the results are shown to simplify significantly and we find an unexpected connection with the combinatorics of set partitions. Finally, we study the system from the point of view of the tracer particle, the so-called environment process. In the environment process, we show that the density of particles decays exponentially with the scaled position in front of the tracer particle in the thermodynamic limit.',\n",
       " 'The non-local nature of the correlations possessed by quantum systems may be revealed by experimental demonstrations of the violation of Bell-type inequalities. Recent work has placed bounds on the correlations that quantum systems can possess in an actual experiment. These bounds were limited to a composite quantum system comprising of a few lower-dimensional subsystems. In a more general approach, it has been shown that fewer body correlations can reveal the non-local nature of the correlations arising from a quantum mechanical description of nature. Such tests on the correlations can be transformed to a semi-definite program (SDP). This study reports the experimental implementation of a local measurement-based hierarchy on the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) hardware utilizing three nuclear spins as qubits. The protocol has been experimentally tested on genuinely entangled tripartite states such as W state, GHZ state and a few graph states. In all the cases, the experimentally measured correlations were used to formulate the SDP, using linear constraints on the entries of the moment matrix. We observed that for each genuinely entangled state, the SDP failed to find a semi-definite positive moment matrix consistent with the experimental data. This implies that the observed correlations can not arise from local measurements on a separable state and are hence non-local in nature, and also confirms that the states being tested are indeed entangled.',\n",

In response, we present the Embedding Comparator, an interactive system that balances gaining an overview of the embedding spaces with making fine-grained comparisons of local neighborhoods. For a pair of models, we compute the similarity of the k-nearest neighbors of every embedded object, and visualize the results as Local Neighborhood Dominoes: small multiples that facilitate rapid comparisons.

We collect RR interval time series data from nearly 100 firefighter trainees that participated in a drill.

We demonstrate that K-Means combined with engineered features is unable to capture meaningful structure within the data. On the other hand, convolutional and LSTM autoencoders tend to extract varying structure from the data pointing to different clusters with different sizes of clusters. We attempt at identifying the true stressed and normal clusters using the HRV markers of mental stress reported in the literature. We demonstrate that the clusters produced by the convolutional autoencoders consistently and successfully stratify stressed versus normal samples, as validated by several established physiological stress markers such as RMSSD, Max-HR, Mean-HR and LF-HF ratio.',\n",

We describe a modeling framework JANOS that seamlessly integrates the two streams of analytics, for the first time allowing researchers and practitioners to embed machine learning models in an optimization framework. JANOS allows for specifying a prescriptive model using standard optimization modeling elements such as constraints and variables. The key novelty lies in providing modeling constructs that allow for the specification of commonly used predictive models and their features as constraints and variables in the optimization model. The framework considers two sets of decision variables; regular and predicted. The relationship between the regular and the predicted variables are specified by the user as pre-trained predictive models. JANOS currently supports linear regression, logistic regression, and neural network with rectified linear activation functions, but we plan to expand on this set in the future.

       " 'One key use of k-means clustering is to identify cluster prototypes which can serve as representative points for a dataset. However, a drawback of using k-means cluster centers as representative points is that such points distort the distribution of the underlying data. This can be highly disadvantageous in problems where the representative points are subsequently used to gain insights on the data distribution, as these points do not mimic the distribution of the data. To this end, we propose a new clustering method called \"distributional clustering\", which ensures cluster centers capture the distribution of the underlying data. We first prove the asymptotic convergence of the proposed cluster centers to the data generating distribution, then present an efficient algorithm for computing these cluster centers in practice. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of distributional clustering on synthetic and real datasets.',\n",

       " 'Task-oriented dialog presents a difficult challenge encompassing multiple problems including multi-turn language understanding and generation, knowledge retrieval and reasoning, and action prediction. Modern dialog systems typically begin by converting conversation history to a symbolic object referred to as belief state by using supervised learning. The belief state is then used to reason on an external knowledge source whose result along with the conversation history is used in action prediction and response generation tasks independently. Such a pipeline of individually optimized components not only makes the development process cumbersome but also makes it non-trivial to leverage session-level user reinforcement signals. In this paper, we develop Neural Assistant: a single neural network model that takes conversation history and an external knowledge source as input and jointly produces both text response and action to be taken by the system as output. The model learns to reason on the provided knowledge source with weak supervision signal coming from the text generation and the action prediction tasks, hence removing the need for belief state annotations. In the MultiWOZ dataset, we study the effect of distant supervision, and the size of knowledge base on model performance. We find that the Neural Assistant without belief states is able to incorporate external knowledge information achieving higher factual accuracy scores compared to Transformer. In settings comparable to reported baseline systems, Neural Assistant when provided with oracle belief state significantly improves language generation performance.',\n",
       " 'Industrial process control systems are time-critical systems where reliable communications between sensors and actuators need to be guaranteed within strict deadlines to maintain safe operation of all the components of the system. WirelessHART is the most widely adopted standard which serve as the medium of communication in industrial setups due to its support for Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)based communication, multiple channels, channel hopping, centralized architecture, redundant routes and avoidance of spatial re-use of channels. However, the communication schedule in WirelessHART network is decided by a centralized network manager at the time of network initialization and the same communication schedule repeats every hyper-period. Due to predictability in the time slots of the communication schedule, these systems are vulnerable to timing attacks which eventually can disrupt the safety of the system. In this work, we present a moving target defense mechanism, the SlotSwapper, which uses schedule randomization techniques to randomize the time slots over a hyper-period schedule, while still preserving all the feasibility constraints of a real-time WirelessHART network and makes the schedule uncertain every hyper-period. We tested the feasibility of the generated schedules on random topologies with 100 simulated motes in Cooja simulator.

       " 'Mechanical metamaterials are usually designed to show desired responses to prescribed forces. In some applications, the desired force-response relationship might be hard to specify exactly, although examples of forces and corresponding desired responses are easily available. Here we propose a framework for supervised learning in a thin creased sheet that learns the desired force-response behavior from training examples of spatial force patterns and can then respond correctly to previously unseen test forces. During training, we fold the sheet using different training forces and assume a learning rule that changes stiffness of creases in response to their folding strain. We find that this learning process reshapes non-linearities inherent in folding a sheet so as to show the correct response for previously unseen test forces. We study the relationship between training error, test error and sheet size which plays the role of model complexity. Our framework shows how the complex energy landscape of disordered mechanical materials can be reshaped using an iterative local learning rule.',\n",
       " \"We show that simple, commercially sourced n-channel silicon field-effect transistors (nFETs) operating under closed loop control exhibit an ~3-fold improvement in pH readout resolution to (7.2+/-0.3)x10^-3 at a bandwidth of 10 Hz when compared with the open loop operation commonly employed by integrated ion-sensitive field-effect transistors (ISFETs). We leveraged the improved nFET performance to measure the change in solution pH arising from the activity of a pathological form of the kinase Cdk5, an enzyme implicated in Alzheimer's disease, and showed quantitative agreement with previous measurements. The improved pH resolution was realized while the devices were operated in a remote sensing configuration with the pH sensing element off-chip and connected electrically to the FET gate terminal. We compared these results with those measured by using a custom-built dual-gate 2D field-effect transistor (dg2DFET) fabricated with 2D semi-conducting MoS2 channels and a moderate device gain, alpha=8. Under identical solution conditions the pH resolution of the nFETs was only 2-fold worse than the dg2DFETs pH resolution of (3.9+/-0.7)x10^-3. Finally, using the nFETs, we demonstrated the effectiveness of a custom polypeptide, p5, as a therapeutic agent in restoring the function of Cdk5. We expect that the straight-forward modifications to commercially sourced nFETs demonstrated here will lower the barrier to widespread adoption of these remote-gate devices and enable sensitive bioanalytical measurements for high throughput screening in drug discovery and precision medicine applications.\",\n",
       " 'Living systems evolve one mutation at a time, but a single mutation can alter the effect of subsequent mutations. The underlying mechanistic determinants of such epistasis are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the physical dynamics of a biological system can generically constrain epistasis. We analyze models and experimental data on proteins and regulatory networks. In each, we find that if the long-time physical dynamics is dominated by a slow, collective mode, then the dimensionality of mutational effects is reduced. Consequently, epistatic coefficients for different combinations of mutations are no longer independent, even if individually strong. Such epistasis can be summarized as resulting from a global non-linearity applied to an underlying linear trait, i.e., as global epistasis. This constraint, in turn, reduces the ruggedness of the sequence-to-function map. By providing a generic mechanistic origin for experimentally observed global epistasis, our work suggests that slow collective physical modes can make biological systems evolvable.',\n",

However, the precise conditions that are required to advance to an efficiency regime above monocrystalline silicon cells are not well understood. In this work, we establish a simulation model that well describes efficient p-i-n type perovskite solar cells (PCE~20%) and a range of different experiments helping to quantify the efficiency-limiting processes in state-of-the-art devices. Based on these results, we studied the role of important device and material parameters with a particular focus on chemical doping, carrier mobilities, energy level alignment and the built-in potential (V_BI) across all stack layers. We demonstrate that an efficiency regime of 30% can be unlocked by optimizing the built-in potential across the perovskite layer by using either highly doped (10^19 cm-3) thick transport layers (TLs) or ultrathin undoped TLs, e.g. self-assembled monolayers. Importantly, we only consider parameters that have been already demonstrated in recent literature, that is a bulk lifetime of 10 us, interfacial recombination velocities of 100 cm/s, a perovskite bandgap (E_gap) of 1.47 eV and an EQE of 95%. A maximum efficiency of 31% is obtained for a bandgap of 1.4 eV using doped TLs.

In QA hardware, each decision variable of a QUBO should be mapped to one or more adjacent qubits in such a way that pairs of variables defining a quadratic term in the objective function are mapped to some pair of adjacent qubits. However, qubits have limited connectivity in existing QA hardware. This has spurred work on preprocessing algorithms for embedding the graph representing problem variables with quadratic terms in the hardware graph representing qubits adjacencies, such as the Chimera graph in hardware produced by D-Wave Systems.In this paper, we use integer linear programming to search for an embedding of the problem graph into certain classes of minors of the Chimera graph, which we call template embeddings. One of these classes corresponds to complete bipartite graphs, for which we show the limitation of the existing approach based on minimum Odd Cycle Transversals (OCTs). Some of the formulations presented are exact, and thus can be used to certify the absence of a minor embedding.

       " 'Simulations of biological macromolecules play an important role in understanding the physical basis of a number of complex processes such as protein folding. Even with increasing computational power and evolution of specialized architectures, the ability to simulate protein folding at atomistic scales still remains challenging. This stems from the dual aspects of high dimensionality of protein conformational landscapes, and the inability of atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to sufficiently sample these landscapes to observe folding events. Machine learning/deep learning (ML/DL) techniques, when combined with atomistic MD simulations offer the opportunity to potentially overcome these limitations by: (1) effectively reducing the dimensionality of MD simulations to automatically build latent representations that correspond to biophysically relevant reaction coordinates (RCs), and (2) driving MD simulations to automatically sample potentially novel conformational states based on these RCs. We examine how coupling DL approaches with MD simulations can fold small proteins effectively on supercomputers. In particular, we study the computational costs and effectiveness of scaling DL-coupled MD workflows by folding two prototypical systems, viz., Fs-peptide and the fast-folding variant of the villin head piece protein. We demonstrate that a DL driven MD workflow is able to effectively learn latent representations and drive adaptive simulations. Compared to traditional MD-based approaches, our approach achieves an effective performance gain in sampling the folded states by at least 2.3x. Our study provides a quantitative basis to understand how DL driven MD simulations, can lead to effective performance gains and reduced times to solution on supercomputing resources.',\n",

We identify that using state-of-the-art technologies may introduce more barriers to access than they remove, and that expectations of research novelty may not produce outcomes well-aligned with the needs of disability communities. Instead, to promote a more inclusive design process, we emphasize the importance of clearly communicating goals, following existing accessibility guidelines, and treating PWD as equal participants who are compensated for their specialized skills. To illustrate how these considerations can be applied in practice, we discuss a case study of an inclusive design workshop held in collaboration with the Perkins School for the Blind.',\n",
       " 'Machine learning (ML) techniques are increasingly applied to decision-making and control problems in Cyber-Physical Systems among which many are safety-critical, e.g., chemical plants, robotics, autonomous vehicles. Despite the significant benefits brought by ML techniques, they also raise additional safety issues because 1) most expressive and powerful ML models are not transparent and behave as a black box and 2) the training data which plays a crucial role in ML safety is usually incomplete. An important technique to achieve safety for ML models is \"Safe Fail\", i.e., a model selects a reject option and applies the backup solution, a traditional controller or a human operator for example, when it has low confidence in a prediction.\\n  Data-driven models produced by ML algorithms learn from training data, and hence they are only as good as the examples they have learnt. As pointed in [17], ML models work well in the \"training space\" (i.e., feature space with sufficient training data), but they could not extrapolate beyond the training space. As observed in many previous studies, a feature space that lacks training data generally has a much higher error rate than the one that contains sufficient training samples [31]. Therefore, it is essential to identify the training space and avoid extrapolating beyond the training space. In this paper, we propose an efficient Feature Space Partitioning Tree (FSPT) to address this problem. Using experiments, we also show that, a strong relationship exists between model performance and FSPT score.',\n",

A comparable understanding in higher dimensions has yet to emerge. We report the creation of three-dimensional active nematics by dispersing extensile microtubule bundles in a passive colloidal liquid crystal. Light-sheet microscopy reveals the millimeter-scale structure of active nematics with a single bundle resolution and the temporal evolution of the associated nematic director field. The dominant excitations of three-dimensional active nematics are extended charge-neutral disclination loops that undergo complex dynamics and recombination events. These studies introduce a new class of non-equilibrium systems whose turbulent-like dynamics arises from the interplay between internally generated active stresses, the chaotic flows and the topological structure of the constituent defects.',\n",

In this paper we focus on the first task, and present a Compliance Change Tracking System, that gathers regulatory announcements from government sites, news sites, email subscriptions; classifies their importance i.e Actionability through a hierarchical classifier, and business process applicability through a multi-class classifier. For these classifiers, we experiment with several approaches such as vanilla classification methods (e.g. Naive Bayes, logistic regression etc.), hierarchical classification methods, rule based approach, hybrid approach with various preprocessing and feature selection methods; and show that despite the richness of other models, a simple hierarchical classification with bag-of-words features works the best for Actionability classifier and multi-class logistic regression works the best for Applicability classifier.

The deformation profiles of the lamellae are experimentally evaluated using confocal microscopy. These experimental results are then explained using a variational principle formalism within the framework of linear elasticity. We show that the local deformation profile of a lamella is mainly controlled by the net horizontal component of the capillary forces acting on its top due to the pinned droplet contact line. We also discuss the indirect role of electrowetting in dictating the deformation characteristics of the elastic lamellae. One important conclusion is that the small deflection assumption, which is frequently used in the literature, fails to provide a quantitative description of the experimental results; a full solution of the non-linear governing equation is necessary to describe the experimentally obtained deflection profiles.',\n",

A thermodynamically consistent form of the Tsallis distribution is used to extract the kinetic freeze-out parameters from the transverse momentum spectra of charged particles at mid-rapidity. In addition, a comprehensive study of fitting range dependence of transverse momentum spectra on the freeze-out parameters is done using Tsallis statistics. The applicability of BGBW model is verified by fitting the transverse momentum spectra of the bulk part ($\\\\sim 2.5~ {\\\\rm GeV}/c$)for both 5.02 and 13 TeV energies and also in different multiplicity classes. The radial flow, $<β>$ is almost independent of collision energy and multiplicity whereas the behavior of kinetic freeze-out temperature significantly depends on multiplicity classes.

       " 'Significant progress in computer hardware and software have enabled molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to model complex biological phenomena such as protein folding. However, enabling MD simulations to access biologically relevant timescales (e.g., beyond milliseconds) still remains challenging. These limitations include (1) quantifying which set of states have already been (sufficiently) sampled in an ensemble of MD runs, and (2) identifying novel states from which simulations can be initiated to sample rare events (e.g., sampling folding events). With the recent success of deep learning and artificial intelligence techniques in analyzing large datasets, we posit that these techniques can also be used to adaptively guide MD simulations to model such complex biological phenomena. Leveraging our recently developed unsupervised deep learning technique to cluster protein folding trajectories into partially folded intermediates, we build an iterative workflow that enables our generative model to be coupled with all-atom MD simulations to fold small protein systems on emerging high performance computing platforms. We demonstrate our approach in folding Fs-peptide and the $ββα$ (BBA) fold, FSD-EY. Our adaptive workflow enables us to achieve an overall root-mean squared deviation (RMSD) to the native state of 1.6$~Å$ and 4.4~$Å$ respectively for Fs-peptide and FSD-EY.

Consequently, these excess visible photons possibly can explain the reported EDGES anomaly in the 21 cm signal. Further, we explore the parameter space for which the 21 cm signal can provide the region to probe the dark radiation and the DM viscosity.',\n",
       " 'Slender filaments clamped at both ends and pre-stressed into a buckled planar shape are known to exhibit stable flapping oscillations in a dissipative medium under nonconservative follower forces. However, beyond a critical pre-stress value clamped rods transition to an out-of-plane (bent and twisted) equilibrium shape in the absence of follower forces. We analyze the nonlinear three-dimensional spatiotemporal dynamics of these three-dimensional pre-stressed shapes under the action of follower forces. In this regime, we find emergence of swirling oscillations with two characteristic time-scales with the first time scale characterizing a purely rotational (swirling) motion around the end-to-end axis of the filament and the second time scale capturing the rate at which the direction of swirling oscillations are reversed. This reversal of swirling oscillations resembles relaxation oscillations where a sudden jump in torsional deformation is followed by a period of gradual decrease in net torsion leading to the next cycle of variations. Our work suggests means by which mechanical deformation mediated by non-conservative follower force may be used to generate oscillatory behavior that can pump or mix fluid at macroscales.',\n",

Such `generalists' can be hard to evolve, out-competed by specialists fitter in any particular environment. Here, inspired by the search for broadly-neutralising antibodies during B-cell affinity maturation, we demonstrate that environmental changes on an intermediate timescale can reliably evolve generalists, even when faster or slower environmental changes are unable to do so. We find that changing environments on timescales comparable to evolutionary transients in a population enhances the rate of evolving generalists from specialists, without enhancing the reverse process. The yield of generalists is further increased in more complex dynamic environments, such as a `chirp' of increasing frequency. Our work offers design principles for how non-equilibrium fitness `seascapes' can dynamically funnel populations to genotypes unobtainable in static environments.\",\n",

In addition, we leverage the sequential nature of learning for both LSTMs and NODEs to demonstrate their capability for closure in systems which are not completely resolved in the reduced space. We assess our hypothesis for two advection-dominated problems given by the viscous Burgers equation. It is observed that both LSTMs and NODEs are able to reproduce the effects of the absent scales for our test cases more effectively than intrusive dynamics evolution through a Galerkin projection.

       " \"Auto-regressive models are widely used in sequence generation problems. The output sequence is typically generated in a predetermined order, one discrete unit (pixel or word or character) at a time. The models are trained by teacher-forcing where ground-truth history is fed to the model as input, which at test time is replaced by the model prediction. Scheduled Sampling aims to mitigate this discrepancy between train and test time by randomly replacing some discrete units in the history with the model's prediction. While teacher-forced training works well with ML accelerators as the computation can be parallelized across time, Scheduled Sampling involves undesirable sequential processing. In this paper, we introduce a simple technique to parallelize Scheduled Sampling across time. Experimentally, we find the proposed technique leads to equivalent or better performance on image generation, summarization, dialog generation, and translation compared to teacher-forced training. In dialog response generation task, Parallel Scheduled Sampling achieves 1.6 BLEU score (11.5%) improvement over teacher-forcing while in image generation it achieves 20% and 13.8% improvement in Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score (IS) respectively.

       " 'Elastically driven filaments subjected to animating compressive follower forces provide a synthetic way to mimic the oscillatory beating of active biological filaments such as eukaryotic cilia. The dynamics of such active filaments can, under favorable conditions, exhibit stable time-periodic responses that result due to the interplay of elastic buckling instabilities, geometric constraints, boundary conditions, and dissipation due to fluid drag. In this paper, we use a continuum elastic rod model to estimate the critical follower force required for the onset of the stable time-periodic flapping oscillations in pre-stressed rods subjected to fluid drag. The pre-stress is generated by imposing either clamped-clamped or clamped-pinned boundary constraints and the results are compared with those of clamped-free case, which is without pre-stress. We find that the critical value increases with the initial slack--that quantifies the pre-stress, and strongly depends on the type of the constraints at the boundaries. The frequency of oscillations far from the onset, however, depends primarily on the magnitude of the follower force, not on the boundary constraints. Interestingly, oscillations for the clamped-pinned case are observed only when the follower forces are directed towards the clamped end. This finding can be exploited to design a mechanical switch to initiate or quench the oscillations by reversing the direction of the follower force or altering the boundary conditions.',\n",

We argue that, while studying the QGP-like conditions in small systems, one should separate the isotropic events from the spherocity-integrated events, as the production dynamics are different.',\n",
       " 'Many applications in data science and scientific computing involve large-scale datasets that are expensive to store and compute with, but can be efficiently compressed and stored in an appropriate tensor format. In recent years, randomized matrix methods have been used to efficiently and accurately compute low-rank matrix decompositions. Motivated by this success, we focus on developing randomized algorithms for tensor decompositions in the Tucker representation. Specifically, we present randomized versions of two well-known compression algorithms, namely, HOSVD and STHOSVD. We present a detailed probabilistic analysis of the error of the randomized tensor algorithms. We also develop variants of these algorithms that tackle specific challenges posed by large-scale datasets. The first variant adaptively finds a low-rank representation satisfying a given tolerance and it is beneficial when the target-rank is not known in advance. The second variant preserves the structure of the original tensor, and is beneficial for large sparse tensors that are difficult to load in memory. We consider several different datasets for our numerical experiments: synthetic test tensors and realistic applications such as the compression of facial image samples in the Olivetti database and word counts in the Enron email dataset.',\n",
       " \"Computing Nash equilibrium (NE) of multi-player games has witnessed renewed interest due to recent advances in generative adversarial networks. However, computing equilibrium efficiently is challenging. To this end, we introduce the Gradient-based Nikaido-Isoda (GNI) function which serves: (i) as a merit function, vanishing only at the first-order stationary points of each player's optimization problem, and (ii) provides error bounds to a stationary Nash point. Gradient descent is shown to converge sublinearly to a first-order stationary point of the GNI function. For the particular case of bilinear min-max games and multi-player quadratic games, the GNI function is convex. Hence, the application of gradient descent in this case yields linear convergence to an NE (when one exists). In our numerical experiments, we observe that the GNI formulation always converges to the first-order stationary point of each player's optimization problem.\",\n",
       " 'In a recent paper, Ayyer and Behrend present for a wide class of partitions factorizations of Schur polynomials with an even number of variables where half of the variables are the reciprocals of the others into symplectic and/or orthogonal group characters, thereby generalizing results of Ciucu and Krattenthaler for rectangular shapes. Their proofs proceed by manipulations of determinants underlying the characters. The purpose of the current paper is to provide bijective proofs of such factorizations. The quantities involved have known combinatorial interpretations in terms of Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns of various types or half Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns, which can in turn be transformed into perfect matchings of weighted trapezoidal honeycomb graphs. An important ingredient is then Ciucu\\'s theorem for graphs with reflective symmetry. However, before being able to apply it, we need to employ a certain averaging procedure in order to achieve symmetric edge weights. This procedure is based on a \"randomized\" bijection, which can however also be turned into a classical bijection. For one type of Schur polynomial factorization, we also need an additional graph operation that almost doubles the underlying graph. Finally, our combinatorial proofs reveal that the factorizations under consideration can in fact also be generalized to skew shapes as discussed at the end of the paper.',\n",
       " \"Researchers currently rely on ad hoc datasets to train automated visualization tools and evaluate the effectiveness of visualization designs. These exemplars often lack the characteristics of real-world datasets, and their one-off nature makes it difficult to compare different techniques. In this paper, we present VizNet: a large-scale corpus of over 31 million datasets compiled from open data repositories and online visualization galleries. On average, these datasets comprise 17 records over 3 dimensions and across the corpus, we find 51% of the dimensions record categorical data, 44% quantitative, and only 5% temporal. VizNet provides the necessary common baseline for comparing visualization design techniques, and developing benchmark models and algorithms for automating visual analysis. To demonstrate VizNet's utility as a platform for conducting online crowdsourced experiments at scale, we replicate a prior study assessing the influence of user task and data distribution on visual encoding effectiveness, and extend it by considering an additional task: outlier detection. To contend with running such studies at scale, we demonstrate how a metric of perceptual effectiveness can be learned from experimental results, and show its predictive power across test datasets.\",\n",
       " 'We propose a framework to model ferroelectric negative capacitance: electrostatic Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) hybrid actuators and analyze their dynamic (step input) response. Using this framework, we report the first proposal for reduction in the dynamic pull-in and pull-out voltages of the hybrid actuators due to the negative capacitance of the ferroelectric. The proposed model also reveals the effect of ferroelectric thickness on the dynamic pull-in and pull-out voltages and the effect of ferroelectric damping on the energy dissipated during actuation. We infer from our analysis that the hybrid actuators are better than the standalone MEMS actuators in terms of operating voltage and energy dissipation. Further, we show that one can trade-off a small part of the reduction in actuation voltage to achieve identical pull-in times in the hybrid and standalone MEMS actuators, while still consuming substantially lower energy in the former as compared to the latter. The circuit compatibility of the proposed hybrid actuator model makes it suitable for analysis and evaluation of various heterogeneous systems consisting of hybrid MEMS actuators and other electronic devices.',\n",

It is now known that the problem can be solved in deterministic polynomial time in the white-box model for noncommutative formulas with inverses, and in randomized polynomial time in the black-box model [GGOW16, IQS18, DM18], where the running time is polynomial in the size of the formula. The complexity of identity testing of noncommutative rational functions remains open in general (when the formula size is not polynomially bounded). We solve the problem for a natural special case. We consider polynomial expressions in the free group algebra $\\\\mathbb{F}\\\\langle X, X^{-1}\\\\rangle$ where $X=\\\\{x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots, x_n\\\\}$, a subclass of rational expressions of inversion height one.

Our key insight is that any communication protocol that operates below the noise floor has to use coding at the physical layer. We show that neural networks can be used as a general algorithmic framework that can learn the coding mechanisms being employed by such protocols to identify signals that are hidden within noise. Our evaluation shows that DeepSense performs carrier sense across 26 different LPWAN protocols and configurations below the noise floor and can operate in the presence of frequency shifts as well as concurrent transmissions. Beyond carrier sense, we also show that DeepSense can support multi bit-rate LoRa networks by classifying between 21 different LoRa configurations and flexibly adapting bitrates based on signal strength. In a deployment of a multi-rate LoRa network, DeepSense improves bit rate by 4x for nearby devices and provides a 1.7x increase in the number of locations that can connect to the campus-wide network.',\n",

Optical gas imaging (OGI) is a widely-used method to detect methane leaks, but is labor-intensive and cannot provide leak detection results without operators' judgment. In this paper, we develop a computer vision approach to OGI-based leak detection using convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained on methane leak images to enable automatic detection. First, we collect ~1 M frames of labeled video of methane leaks from different leaking equipment for building CNN model, covering a wide range of leak sizes (5.3-2051.6 gCH4/h) and imaging distances (4.6-15.6 m). Second, we examine different background subtraction methods to extract the methane plume in the foreground. Third, we then test three CNN model variants, collectively called GasNet, to detect plumes in videos taken at other pieces of leaking equipment. We assess the ability of GasNet to perform leak detection by comparing it to a baseline method that uses optical-flow based change detection algorithm. We explore the sensitivity of results to the CNN structure, with a moderate-complexity variant performing best across distances. We find that the detection accuracy can reach as high as 99%, the overall detection accuracy can exceed 95% for a case across all leak sizes and imaging distances. Binary detection accuracy exceeds 97% for large leaks (~710 gCH4/h) imaged closely (~5-7 m). At closer imaging distances (~5-10 m), CNN-based models have greater than 94% accuracy across all leak sizes. At farthest distances (~13-16 m), performance degrades rapidly, but it can achieve above 95% accuracy to detect large leaks (>950 gCH4/h). The GasNet-based computer vision approach could be deployed in OGI surveys to allow automatic vigilance of methane leak detection with high detection accuracy in the real world.\",\n",

The stability of on-chip oscillators is orders of magnitude worse than that of a crystal. It is known that as the temperature changes, they can drift more than 50 ppm/°C. This paper presents the result of an extensive experimental study. First, we propose mechanisms for crystal-free radios to be able to track an IEEE802.15.4 join proxy, calibrate the on-chip oscillators and maintain calibration against temperature changes. Then, we implement the resulting algorithms on a crystal-free platform and present the results of an experimental validation.

       " \"SREC markets are a relatively novel market-based system to incentivize the production of energy from solar means. A regulator imposes a floor on the amount of energy each regulated firm must generate from solar power in a given period and provides them with certificates for each generated MWh. Firms offset these certificates against the floor and pay a penalty for any lacking certificates. Certificates are tradable assets, allowing firms to purchase/sell them freely. In this work, we formulate a stochastic control problem for generating and trading in SREC markets from a regulated firm's perspective. We account for generation and trading costs, the impact both have on SREC prices, provide a characterization of the optimal strategy, and develop a numerical algorithm to solve this control problem. Through numerical experiments, we explore how a firm who acts optimally behaves under various conditions. We find that an optimal firm's generation and trading behaviour can be separated into various regimes, based on the marginal benefit of obtaining an additional SREC, and validate our theoretical characterization of the optimal strategy. We also conduct parameter sensitivity experiments and conduct comparisons of the optimal strategy to other candidate strategies.\",\n",

However, several processing challenges related to organic contamination at the interfaces of the 2D material and the gate oxide must be overcome to realize robust devices with high yield. Here, we demonstrate an optimized process to realize high-performance field-effect transistor (FET) arrays from large-area (~5000 um2) monolayer MoS2 with a yield of 85 %. A central element of this process is an exposed material forming gas anneal (EM-FGA) that results in uniform FET performance metrics (i.e., field-effect mobilities, threshold voltages, and contact performance). Complementary analytical measurements show that the EM-FGA process reduces deleterious channel doping effects by decreasing organic contamination, while also reducing the prevalence of insulating molybdenum oxide, effectively improving the MoS2-gate oxide interface. The uniform FET performance metrics and high device yield achieved by applying the EM-FGA technique on large-area 2D material flakes will help advance the fabrication of complex 2D nanoelectronics devices and demonstrates the need for improved engineering of the 2D material-gate oxide interface.',\n",

In the context of dynamical system analysis, the extracted dynamic modes are a generalization of global stability modes. We apply DMD to a data matrix whose rows are linearly independent, additive mixtures of latent time series. We show that when the latent time series are uncorrelated at a lag of one time-step then, in the large sample limit, the recovered dynamic modes will approximate, up to a column-wise normalization, the columns of the mixing matrix. Thus, DMD is a time series blind source separation algorithm in disguise, but is different from closely related second order algorithms such as the Second-Order Blind Identification (SOBI) method and the Algorithm for Multiple Unknown Signals Extraction (AMUSE). All can unmix mixed stationary, ergodic Gaussian time series in a way that kurtosis-based Independent Components Analysis (ICA) fundamentally cannot. We use our insights on single lag DMD to develop a higher-lag extension, analyze the finite sample performance with and without randomly missing data, and identify settings where the higher lag variant can outperform the conventional single lag variant. We validate our results with numerical simulations, and highlight how DMD can be used in change point detection.',\n",

We show that while designed states are stable in networks of linear Hookean springs, sequential learning requires specific non-linear elasticity.

The analysis focuses on points of the region that are on trajectories that contain a corner or on cycles of full rank, or are crossing points thereof.\\n  As a consequence, we give a simple proof that the period of the bishops' counting quasipolynomial is 2, and provide formulas bounding periods of counting quasipolynomials for many two-move riders including all partial nightriders. We draw parallels to the theory of mathematical billiards and pose many new open questions.\",\n",

       " 'Remote detection of the cardiac pulse has a number of applications in sports and medicine, and can be used to determine the physiological state of the subject. Previous approaches to estimate Heart Rate from video require the subject to remain stationary and employ background information to eliminate illumination interferences. The present research proposes a spectral reflectance based novel illumination rectification method to eliminate illumination variations in the video. Our method does not rely on the background of the video and is robust to extreme motion interferences (head movements). Furthermore, in order to tackle extreme motion artifacts, the present framework introduces a novel feature point recovery system which recovers the feature tracking points lost during extreme head movements of the subject. Finally, the individual HR estimates from multiple feature points are combined to produce an average HR. We evaluate the efficacy of our framework on the MAHNOB HCI dataset, a publicly available dataset employed by previous methods. Our HR measurement framework outperformed previous methods and had a root mean square error of 5.21%.',\n",

MI6 is inspired by Sanctum [16] and extends its isolation guarantee to more realistic memory hierarchies. It also introduces a purge instruction, which is used only when a secure process is scheduled, and implements it for a complex processor microarchitecture.

       " 'Virtual execution environments allow for consolidation of multiple applications onto the same physical server, thereby enabling more efficient use of server resources. However, users often statically configure the resources of virtual machines through guesswork, resulting in either insufficient resource allocations that hinder VM performance, or excessive allocations that waste precious data center resources. In this paper, we first characterize real-world resource allocation and utilization of VMs through the analysis of an extensive dataset, consisting of more than 250k VMs from over 3.6k private enterprise clusters. Our large-scale analysis confirms that VMs are often misconfigured, either overprovisioned or underprovisioned, and that this problem is pervasive across a wide range of private clusters. We then propose ADARES, an adaptive system that dynamically adjusts VM resources using machine learning techniques. In particular, ADARES leverages the contextual bandits framework to effectively manage the adaptations. Our system exploits easily collectible data, at the cluster, node, and VM levels, to make more sensible allocation decisions, and uses transfer learning to safely explore the configurations space and speed up training. Our empirical evaluation shows that ADARES can significantly improve system utilization without sacrificing performance. For instance, when compared to threshold and prediction-based baselines, it achieves more predictable VM-level performance and also reduces the amount of virtual CPUs and memory provisioned by up to 35% and 60% respectively for synthetic workloads on real clusters.',\n",

We evaluate common approaches for defending against these types of traffic analysis attacks, including firewalls, virtual private networks, and independent link padding, and find that none sufficiently conceal user activities with reasonable data overhead. We develop a new defense, \"stochastic traffic padding\" (STP), that makes it difficult for a passive network adversary to reliably distinguish genuine user activities from generated traffic patterns designed to look like user interactions. Our analysis provides a theoretical bound on an adversary\\'s ability to accurately detect genuine user activities as a function of the amount of additional cover traffic generated by the defense technique.',\n",

The decuplet baryon masses decrease, whereas, the magnetic moments increase significantly with the rise of baryonic density of the symmetric nuclear medium.

It may be interesting to perform a double differential study of different observables in pp collisions in terms of charged particle multiplicity and event shape in order to understand the new dimensions in high-multiplicity pp physics. We study the correlation between the number of multi-partonic interactions (nMPI), event shape (transverse spherocity) and charged particle multiplicity classes. We report the simulation results on the spherocity and multiplicity dependent study of identified particle production in pp collisions at $\\\\sqrt{s}$= 13 TeV using PYTHIA 8.

A clear spherocity dependence of $p_{\\\\rm{T}}$-spectra is observed for all the particles.

The p/$φ$ ratio at low-$p_{\\\\rm T}$ shows a weak $p_{\\\\rm T}$ dependence for high-multiplicity isotropic events, which is a hydrodynamic-like behavior. Larger dependence of integrated yield on spherocity is observed for high multiplicity compared to the low multiplicity pp collisions.

       " \"Hierarchical models in Bayesian inverse problems are characterized by an assumed prior probability distribution for the unknown state and measurement error precision, and hyper-priors for the prior parameters. Combining these probability models using Bayes' law often yields a posterior distribution that cannot be sampled from directly, even for a linear model with Gaussian measurement error and Gaussian prior. Gibbs sampling can be used to sample from the posterior, but problems arise when the dimension of the state is large. This is because the Gaussian sample required for each iteration can be prohibitively expensive to compute, and because the statistical efficiency of the Markov chain degrades as the dimension of the state increases. The latter problem can be mitigated using marginalization-based techniques, but these can be computationally prohibitive as well. In this paper, we combine the low-rank techniques of Brown, Saibaba, and Vallelian (2018) with the marginalization approach of Rue and Held (2005). We consider two variants of this approach: delayed acceptance and pseudo-marginalization. We provide a detailed analysis of the acceptance rates and computational costs associated with our proposed algorithms, and compare their performances on two numerical test cases---image deblurring and inverse heat equation.\",\n",

The presence of molecules in their atmosphere complicates our understanding of their atmospheric properties. But great advances have recently been made in the modeling of M dwarfs due to the revision of solar abundances. Aims. We aim to determine stellar parameters of M dwarfs using high resolution spectra (R = 90 000) simultaneously in the visible and the near-infrared. The high resolution spectra and broad wavelength coverage provide an unique opportunity to understand the onset of dust and cloud formation at cool temperatures. Furthermore, this study will help in understanding the physical processes which occur in a cool atmospheres, particularly, the redistribution of energy from the optical to the near-infrared. Methods. The stellar parameters of M dwarfs in our sample have been determined by comparing the high resolution spectra both in the optical and in the near-infrared simultaneously observed by CARMENES with the synthetic spectra obtained from the BT-Settl model atmosphere. The detailed spectral synthesis of these observed spectra both in the optical and in the near-infrared helps to understand the missing continuum opacity. Results. For the first time, we derive fundamental stellar parameters of M dwarfs using the high resolution optical and near-infrared spectra simultaneously. We determine Teff , log g and [M/H] for 292 M dwarfs of spectral type M0 to M9, where the formation of dust and clouds are important. The derived Teff for the sample ranges from 2300 to 4000 K, values of log g ranges from 4.5 geq log g leq 5.5 and the resulting metallicity ranges from -0.5 geq [M/H] leq +0.5.

In this work, attributing the origin of viscosity to self-interaction of dark matter, we study the viscous cosmology at small redshift $(0\\\\leq z\\\\leq2.5)$. Assuming the cluster scale to be virialized and by modeling a power law behavior of velocity gradients, we calculate the Hubble expansion rate, $H(z)$ and the deceleration parameter, $q(z)$. We then perform a $χ^{2}$ analysis to estimate the best fit model parameters. By using the best fit values, we explain the cosmic chronometer and type Ia supernova data. We conclude that if the dissipative effects become prominent only at the late time of cosmic evolution and are smaller at higher redshift, we can explain the observational data without requiring any dark energy component.

       " 'We consider the flow network model to solve the multiprocessor real-time task scheduling problems. Using the flow network model or its generic form, linear programming (LP) formulation, for the problems is not new. However, the previous works have limitations, for example, that they are classified as offline scheduling techniques since they establish a flow network model or an LP problem considering a very long time interval. In this study, we propose how to construct the flow network model for online scheduling periodic real-time tasks on multiprocessors. Our key idea is to construct the flow network only for the active instances of tasks at the current scheduling time, while guaranteeing the existence of an optimal schedule for the future instances of the tasks. The optimal scheduling is here defined to ensure that all real-time tasks meet their deadlines when the total utilization demand of the given tasks does not exceed the total processing capacity. We then propose the flow network model-based polynomial-time scheduling algorithms. Advantageously, the flow network model allows the task workload to be collected unfairly within a certain time interval without losing the optimality. It thus leads us to designing three unfair-but-optimal scheduling algorithms on both continuous and discrete-time models. Especially, our unfair-but-optimal scheduling algorithm on a discrete-time model is, to the best of our knowledge, the first in the problem domain. We experimentally demonstrate that it significantly alleviates the scheduling overheads, i.e., the reduced number of preemptions with the comparable number of task migrations across processors.',\n",

The predominant approach is to extract hundreds to thousands of image features, including histogram features comprised of summaries of the marginal distribution of pixel intensities, which leads to multiple testing problems and can miss out on insights not contained in the selected features. In this paper, we present methods to model the entire marginal distribution of pixel intensities via the quantile function as functional data, regressed on a set of demographic, clinical, and genetic predictors. We call this approach quantile functional regression, regressing subject-specific marginal distributions across repeated measurements on a set of covariates, allowing us to assess which covariates are associated with the distribution in a global sense, as well as to identify distributional features characterizing these differences, including mean, variance, skewness, and various upper and lower quantiles. To account for smoothness in the quantile functions, we introduce custom basis functions we call quantlets that are sparse, regularized, near-lossless, and empirically defined, adapting to the features of a given data set. We fit this model using a Bayesian framework that uses nonlinear shrinkage of quantlet coefficients to regularize the functional regression coefficients and provides fully Bayesian inference after fitting a Markov chain Monte Carlo. We demonstrate the benefit of the basis space modeling through simulation studies, and apply the method to Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based radiomic dataset from Glioblastoma Multiforme to relate imaging-based quantile functions to demographic, clinical, and genetic predictors, finding specific differences in tumor pixel intensity distribution between males and females and between tumors with and without DDIT3 mutations.',\n",

Different conditions can result in the same total amount of a signaling molecule, differing only in the pattern of the molecular concentration over time. Such temporally coded information can be completely invisible to even state-of-the-art molecular sensors with high chemical specificity that respond only to the total amount of the signaling molecule. Here, we demonstrate design principles for circuits with temporal specificity, that is, molecular circuits that respond to specific temporal patterns in a molecular concentration. We consider pulsatile patterns in a molecular concentration characterized by three fundamental temporal features - time period, duty fraction and number of pulses. We develop circuits that respond to each one of these features while being insensitive to the others.

Proof-of-Stake is an alternative concept that instead selects users to authorize transactions proportional to their wealth (`one coin, one vote'). Some aspects of the two paradigms are the same. For instance, obtaining voting power in Proof-of-Stake has a monetary cost just as in Proof-of-Work: a coin cannot be freely duplicated any more easily than a unit of computation.

It is shown in this paper that a mathematical form of nonlinearity of a PN-junction diode resembles the nonlinear response of electric polarization of a dielectric medium to the electric field.

For a PN-junction diode, higher order nonlinear terms become significant as a voltage across the diode is increased. In this paper, a gradual emergence of a nonlinear regime with the amplitude of a sinusoidal voltage is presented. Higher order harmonics are produced by utilizing the nonlinearity of a single PN-junction diode. An experimental realization of a frequency comb with the highest frequency up to the twentieth harmonics is also presented. In addition, in the same circuit by making the nonlinearity significant up to the second order, an experiment on generation of the sum and difference of frequencies is realized.',\n",
       " 'We present a quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol based on long lived coherent states prepared on superconducting rings with a mesoscopic Josephson junction (dc-SQUIDs). This enables storage of the prepared states for long durations before actually performing the key distribution. Our on-demand QKD protocol is closely related to the coherent state based continuous variable quantum key distribution protocol. A detailed analysis of preparation, evolution and different measurement schemes that are required to be implemented on dc-SQUIDs to carry out the QKD is provided. We present two variants of the protocol, one requiring time stamping of states and offering a higher key rate and the other without time stamping and a lower key rate. This is a step towards having non-photon based QKD protocols which will be eventually desirable as photon states cannot be stored for long and therefore the key distribution has to be implemented immediately after photon exchange has occurred. Our protocol offers an innovative scheme to perform QKD and can be realized using current experimental techniques.',\n",

We work out the circuit complexity for evolving from a nearly Gaussian unentangled reference state to the entangled ground state of the theory. Our approach uses Nielsen's geometric method, which translates into working out the geodesic equation arising from a certain cost functional. We present a general method, making use of integral transforms, to do the required lattice sums analytically and give explicit expressions for the $d=2,3$ cases. Our method enables a study of circuit complexity in the epsilon expansion for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. We find that with increasing dimensionality the circuit depth increases in the presence of the $φ^4$ interaction eventually causing the perturbative calculation to breakdown. We discuss how circuit complexity relates with the renormalization group.\",\n",

Computing the concurrence experimentally under three different bipartitions, for an arbitrary three-qubit pure state, reveals the entanglement class of the state. The experiment involves measuring the expectation values of Pauli operators. This was achieved by mapping the desired expectation values onto the local $z$ magnetization of a single qubit. We tested the entanglement classification protocol on twenty seven different generic states and successfully detected their entanglement class. Full quantum state tomography was performed to construct experimental tomographs of each state and negativity was calculated from them, to validate the experimental results.',\n",

We obtain the multiplicity dependent kinetic freeze-out temperature ($T_{\\\\rm kin}$) and radial flow ($β$) of various particles after fitting the $p_{\\\\rm T}$-distribution with BGBW model. Here, $T_{\\\\rm kin}$ exhibits mild dependence on multiplicity class while $β$ shows almost independent behaviour. The information regarding Tsallis temperature and the non-extensivity parameter ($q$) are drawn by fitting the $p_{\\\\rm T}$-spectra with Tsallis distribution function. The extracted parameters of these particles are studied as a function of charged particle multiplicity density ($dN_{ch}/dη$). In addition to this, we also study these parameters as a function of particle mass to observe any possible mass ordering. All the identified hadrons show a mass ordering in temperature, non-extensive parameter and also a strong dependence on multiplicity classes, except the lighter particles. It is observed that as the particle multiplicity increases, the $q$-parameter approaches to Boltzmann-Gibbs value, hence a conclusion can be drawn that system tends to thermal equilibrium. The observations are consistent with a differential freeze-out scenario of the produced particles.',\n",
       " 'Inferring road attributes such as lane count and road type from satellite imagery is challenging. Often, due to the occlusion in satellite imagery and the spatial correlation of road attributes, a road attribute at one position on a road may only be apparent when considering far-away segments of the road. Thus, to robustly infer road attributes, the model must integrate scattered information and capture the spatial correlation of features along roads. Existing solutions that rely on image classifiers fail to capture this correlation, resulting in poor accuracy. We find this failure is caused by a fundamental limitation -- the limited effective receptive field of image classifiers. To overcome this limitation, we propose RoadTagger, an end-to-end architecture which combines both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to infer road attributes. The usage of graph neural networks allows information propagation on the road network graph and eliminates the receptive field limitation of image classifiers. We evaluate RoadTagger on both a large real-world dataset covering 688 km^2 area in 20 U.S. cities and a synthesized micro-dataset. In the evaluation, RoadTagger improves inference accuracy over the CNN image classifier based approaches. RoadTagger also demonstrates strong robustness against different disruptions in the satellite imagery and the ability to learn complicated inductive rules for aggregating scattered information along the road network.',\n",

However, in many parts of the world, street maps are incomplete or lag behind new construction. Editing maps today involves a tedious process of manually tracing and annotating roads, buildings, and other map features.\\n  Over the past decade, many automatic map inference systems have been proposed to automatically extract street map data from satellite imagery, aerial imagery, and GPS trajectory datasets. However, automatic map inference has failed to gain traction in practice due to two key limitations: high error rates (low precision), which manifest in noisy inference outputs, and a lack of end-to-end system design to leverage inferred data to update existing street maps.\\n  At MIT and QCRI, we have developed a number of algorithms and approaches to address these challenges, which we combined into a new system we call Mapster. Mapster is a human-in-the-loop street map editing system that incorporates three components to robustly accelerate the mapping process over traditional tools and workflows: high-precision automatic map inference, data refinement, and machine-assisted map editing.\\n  Through an evaluation on a large-scale dataset including satellite imagery, GPS trajectories, and ground-truth map data in forty cities, we show that Mapster makes automation practical for map editing, and enables the curation of map datasets that are more complete and up-to-date at less cost.',\n",

In addition, the rapid exchange and influence of ideas across traditional discipline boundaries have made the emphasis on multimedia multimodal research even more important than before. To seize these opportunities and respond to the challenges, we have organized a workshop to specifically address and brainstorm the challenges, opportunities, and research roadmaps for MM research. The two-day workshop, held on March 30 and 31, 2017 in Washington DC, was sponsored by the Information and Intelligent Systems Division of the National Science Foundation of the United States. Twenty-three (23) invited participants were asked to review and identify research areas in the MM field that are most important over the next 10-15 year timeframe. Important topics were selected through discussion and consensus, and then discussed in depth in breakout groups. Breakout groups reported initial discussion results to the whole group, who continued with further extensive deliberation. For each identified topic, a summary was produced after the workshop to describe the main findings, including the state of the art, challenges, and research roadmaps planned for the next 5, 10, and 15 years in the identified area.',\n",

Systems to automatically infer road network graphs from aerial imagery and GPS trajectories have been proposed to improve coverage of road maps. However, because of high error rates, these systems have not been adopted by mapping communities. We propose machine-assisted map editing, where automatic map inference is integrated into existing, human-centric map editing workflows. To realize this, we build Machine-Assisted iD (MAiD), where we extend the web-based OpenStreetMap editor, iD, with machine-assistance functionality. We complement MAiD with a novel approach for inferring road topology from aerial imagery that combines the speed of prior segmentation approaches with the accuracy of prior iterative graph construction methods. We design MAiD to tackle the addition of major, arterial roads in regions where existing maps have poor coverage, and the incremental improvement of coverage in regions where major roads are already mapped. We conduct two user studies and find that, when participants are given a fixed time to map roads, they are able to add as much as 3.5x more roads with MAiD.',\n",
       " \"To reduce transmit power, increase throughput, and improve communication range, radio systems---such as IoT sensor networks, Wi-Fi and cellular networks---benefit from the ability to direct their signals, to ensure that more of the transmitted power reaches the receiver. Many modern systems beamform with antenna arrays for this purpose. However, a radio's ability to direct its signal is fundamentally limited by its size. Unfortunately practical challenges limit the size of modern radios, and consequently, their ability to beamform. In many settings, radios on devices must be small and inexpensive; today, these settings are unable to benefit from high-precision beamforming.\\n  To address this problem, we introduce RFocus, which moves beamforming functions from the radio endpoints to the environment. RFocus includes a two-dimensional surface with a rectangular array of simple elements, each of which functions as an RF switch. Each element either lets the signal through or reflects it. The surface does not emit any power of its own. The state of the elements is set by a software controller to maximize the signal strength at a receiver, with a novel optimization algorithm that uses signal strength measurements from the receiver. The RFocus surface can be manufactured as an inexpensive thin wallpaper, requiring no wiring. This solution requires only a method to communicate received signal strengths periodically to the RFocus controller. Our prototype implementation improves the median signal strength by 10.5x, and the median channel capacity by 2.1x.\",\n",
       " 'We propose Accel-Brake Control (ABC), a simple and deployable explicit congestion control protocol for network paths with time-varying wireless links. ABC routers mark each packet with an \"accelerate\" or \"brake\", which causes senders to slightly increase or decrease their congestion windows. Routers use this feedback to quickly guide senders towards a desired target rate. ABC requires no changes to header formats or user devices, but achieves better performance than XCP. ABC is also incrementally deployable; it operates correctly when the bottleneck is a non-ABC router, and can coexist with non-ABC traffic sharing the same bottleneck link. We evaluate ABC using a Wi-Fi implementation and trace-driven emulation of cellular links. ABC achieves 30-40% higher throughput than Cubic+Codel for similar delays, and 2.2X lower delays than BBR on a Wi-Fi path. On cellular network paths, ABC achieves 50% higher throughput than Cubic+Codel.',\n",

Yet, such methods have not become widespread except for a few niche instances. An important challenge is incentivization: what tangible benefits does P2P content delivery offer users who bring resources to the table? In this paper, we ask whether monetary incentives can help attract peers in P2P content delivery systems. We commissioned a professional survey of people around theUnited States to answer several relevant questions. We found that 51% of the 876 respondents--substantially larger than our expectations--answered \"yes\" to whether they would participate for suitable financial incentives. Encouraged by the results of the survey, we propose Gringotts, a system to structure incentives and securely incorporate P2P delivery into content delivery systems. Gringotts provides a novel Proof of Delivery mechanism that allows content providers to verify correct delivery of their files, and shows how to use cryptocurrency to pay peers while guarding against liars and Sybil attacks.',\n",
       " 'This paper introduces Nimbus, a robust technique to detect whether the cross traffic competing with a flow is \"elastic\", and shows that this elasticity detector improves congestion control. If cross traffic is inelastic, then a sender can control queueing delays while achieving high throughput, but in the presence of elastic traffic, it may lose throughput if it attempts to control packet delay. To estimate elasticity, Nimbus modulates the flow\\'s sending rate with sinusoidal pulses that create small traffic fluctuations at the bottleneck link, and measures the frequency response of the rate of the cross traffic. Our results on emulated and real-world paths show that congestion control using elasticity detection achieves throughput comparable to Cubic, but with delays that are 50-70 ms lower when cross traffic is inelastic. Nimbus detects the nature of the cross traffic more accurately than Copa, and is usable as a building block by other end-to-end algorithms.',\n",

Prior work uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect which pixels belong to a road (segmentation), and then uses complex post-processing heuristics to infer graph connectivity. We show that these segmentation methods have high error rates because noisy CNN outputs are difficult to correct. We propose RoadTracer, a new method to automatically construct accurate road network maps from aerial images. RoadTracer uses an iterative search process guided by a CNN-based decision function to derive the road network graph directly from the output of the CNN. We compare our approach with a segmentation method on fifteen cities, and find that at a 5% error rate, RoadTracer correctly captures 45% more junctions across these cities.',\n",

While we can tweak scheduling parameters, we cannot modify algorithmic logic, or add a completely new algorithm, after the switch has been designed. This paper presents a design for a programmable packet scheduler, which allows scheduling algorithms---potentially algorithms that are unknown today---to be programmed into a switch without requiring hardware redesign.\\n  Our design builds on the observation that scheduling algorithms make two decisions: in what order to schedule packets and when to schedule them. Further, in many scheduling algorithms these decisions can be made when packets are enqueued. We leverage this observation to build a programmable scheduler using a single abstraction: the push-in first-out queue (PIFO), a priority queue that maintains the scheduling order and time for such algorithms.\\n  We show that a programmable scheduler using PIFOs lets us program a wide variety of scheduling algorithms. We present a detailed hardware design for this scheduler for a 64-port 10 Gbit/s shared-memory switch with <4% chip area overhead on a 16-nm standard-cell library. Our design lets us program many sophisticated algorithms, such as a 5-level hierarchical scheduler with programmable scheduling algorithms at each level.',\n",

The key challenge is that these algorithms create and modify algorithmic state. The key idea to achieve line-rate programmability for stateful algorithms is the notion of a packet transaction : a sequential code block that is atomic and isolated from other such code blocks. We have developed this idea in Domino, a C-like imperative language to express data-plane algorithms. We show with many examples that Domino provides a convenient and natural way to express sophisticated data-plane algorithms, and show that these algorithms can be run at line rate with modest estimated die-area overhead.\",\n",
       " 'Fractional Interference Alignment (FIA) is a transmission scheme which achieves any value between [0,1] for the Symbols transmitted per Antenna per Channel use (SpAC). FIA was designed in [1] specifically for Finite Alphabet (FA) signals, under the constraint that the Minimum Distance (MD) detector is used at all the receivers. Similar to classical interference alignment, the FIA precoder also needs perfect channel state information at all the transmitters (CSIT). In this work, a novel Blind Fractional Interference Alignment (B-FIA) scheme is introduced, where the basic assumption is that CSIT is not available. We consider two popular channel models, namely: Broadcast channel, and Interference channel. For these two channel models, the maximum achievable value of SpAC satisfying the constraints of the MD detector is obtained, but with no CSIT, and also a precoder design is provided to obtain any value of SpAC in the achievable range.\\n  Further, the precoder structure provided has one distinct advantage: interference channel state information at the receiver (I-CSIR) is not needed, when all the transmitters and receivers are equipped with one antenna each. When two or more antennas are used at both ends, I-CSIR must be available to obtain the maximum achievable value of SpAC. The receiver designs for both the Minimum Distance and the Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoders are discussed, where the interference statistics is estimated from the received signal samples. Simulation results of the B-FIA show that the ML decoder with estimated statistics achieves a significantly better error rate performance when compared to the MD decoder with known statistics, since the MD decoder assumes the interference plus noise term as colored Gaussian noise.',\n",
       " 'Interference Alignment (IA) is a transmission scheme which achieves 1/2 Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) per transmit-antenna per user. The constraints imposed on the scheme are based on the linear receiver since conventional IA assumes Gaussian signaling. However, when the transmitters employ Finite Alphabet (FA) signaling, neither the conventional IA precoders nor the linear receiver are optimal structures. Therefore, a novel Fractional Interference Alignment (FIA) scheme is introduced when FA signals are used, where the alignment constraints are now based on the non-linear, minimum distance (MD) detector. Since DoF is defined only as signal-to-noise ratio tends to infinity, we introduce a new metric called SpAC (number of Symbols transmitted-per-transmit Antenna-per-Channel use) for analyzing the FIA scheme. The maximum SpAC is one, and the FIA achieves any value of SpAC in the range [0,1]. The key motivation for this work is that numerical simulations with FA signals and MD detector for fixed SpAC (=1/2, as in IA) over a set of optimization problems, like minimizing bit error rate or maximizing the mutual information, achieves a significantly better error rate performance when compared to the existing algorithms that minimize mean square error or maximize signal-to-interference plus noise ratio.',\n",
       " \"This paper presents an analysis of spinal codes, a class of rateless codes proposed recently. We prove that spinal codes achieve Shannon capacity for the binary symmetric channel (BSC) and the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with an efficient polynomial-time encoder and decoder. They are the first rateless codes with proofs of these properties for BSC and AWGN. The key idea in the spinal code is the sequential application of a hash function over the message bits. The sequential structure of the code turns out to be crucial for efficient decoding. Moreover, counter to the wisdom of having an expander structure in good codes, we show that the spinal code, despite its sequential structure, achieves capacity. The pseudo-randomness provided by a hash function suffices for this purpose. Our proof introduces a variant of Gallager's result characterizing the error exponent of random codes for any memoryless channel. We present a novel application of these error-exponent results within the framework of an efficient sequential code. The application of a hash function over the message bits provides a methodical and effective way to de-randomize Shannon's random codebook construction.\",\n",

Prototype micrometer-size devices operate with 8 ns current pulses and the energy consumption required for weight modulation is < 16 pJ.

The same optoelectronic properties that make perovskites ideal absorber materials in solar cells are also beneficial in other light-harvesting applications and make them prime candidates as triplet sensitizers in upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation in rubrene. In this contribution, we take advantage of long carrier lifetimes and carrier diffusion lengths in perovskite thin films, their high absorption cross sections throughout the visible spectrum, as well as the strong spin-orbit coupling owing to the abundance of heavy atoms to sensitize the upconverter rubrene. Employing bulk perovskite thin films as the absorber layer and spin-mixer in inorganic/organic heterojunction upconversion devices allows us to forego the additional tunneling barrier owing from the passivating ligands required for colloidal sensitizers. Our bilayer device exhibits an upconversion efficiency in excess of 3% under 785 nm illumination.',\n",
       " 'High-quality micro-lasers are key ingredients in non-linear optics, communication, sensing and low-threshold solar-pumped lasers. However, such micro-lasers exhibit negligible absorption of free-space broadband pump light. Recently, this limitation was lifted by cascade energy transfer, in which the absorption and quality factor are modulated with wavelength, enabling non-resonant pumping of high-quality micro-lasers and solar-pumped laser to operate at record low solar concentration. Here, we present a generic theoretical framework for modeling the absorption, emission and energy transfer of incoherent radiation between cascade sensitizer and laser gain media. Our model is based on linear equations of the modified net radiation method and is therefore robust, fast converging and has low complexity. We apply this formalism to compute the optimal parameters of low-threshold solar-pumped lasers. It is revealed that the interplay between the absorption and self-absorption of such lasers defines the optimal pump absorption below the maximal value, which is in contrast to conventional lasers for which full pump absorption is desired. Numerical results are compared to experimental data on a sensitized Nd:YAG cavity, and quantitative agreement with theoretical models is found. Our work modularizes the gain and sensitizing components and paves the way for the optimal design of broadband-pumped high-quality micro-lasers and efficient solar-pumped lasers.',\n",

We consider plexcitons emerging from the interaction of excitons in an organic molecular layer with surface plasmons in a metallic film.

These Dirac cones may open up in energy by simultaneously interfacing the metal with a magneto-optical layer and subjecting the whole system to a perpendicular magnetic field. The resulting energy gap becomes populated with topologically protected one-way modes which travel at the interface of this plexcitonic system.

       " 'Organic light emitting devices and solar cells are machines that create, manipulate and destroy excited states in organic semiconductors. It is crucial to characterize these excited states, or excitons, to optimize device performance in applications like displays and solar energy harvesting. This is complicated if the excited state is a triplet because the electronic transition is dark with a vanishing oscillator strength. As a consequence, triplet state spectroscopy must usually be performed at cryogenic temperatures to reduce competition from non-radiative rates. Here, we control non-radiative rates by engineering a solid-state host matrix containing the target molecule, allowing the observation of phosphorescence at room temperature and alleviating constraints of cryogenic experiments. We test these techniques on a wide range of materials with functionalities spanning multi-exciton generation (singlet exciton fission), organic light emitting device host materials, and thermally activated delayed fluorescence type emitters. Control of non-radiative modes in the matrix surrounding a target molecule may also have broader applications in light emitting and photovoltaic devices.',\n",

       " 'Generative models in molecular design tend to be richly parameterized, data-hungry neural models, as they must create complex structured objects as outputs. Estimating such models from data may be challenging due to the lack of sufficient training data. In this paper, we propose a surprisingly effective self-training approach for iteratively creating additional molecular targets. We first pre-train the generative model together with a simple property predictor. The property predictor is then used as a likelihood model for filtering candidate structures from the generative model. Additional targets are iteratively produced and used in the course of stochastic EM iterations to maximize the log-likelihood that the candidate structures are accepted. A simple rejection (re-weighting) sampler suffices to draw posterior samples since the generative model is already reasonable after pre-training. We demonstrate significant gains over strong baselines for both unconditional and conditional molecular design. In particular, our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in conditional molecular design by over 10% in absolute gain.',\n",

These rationales are identified from molecules as substructures that are likely responsible for each property of interest. We then learn to expand rationales into a full molecule using graph generative models. Our final generative model composes molecules as mixtures of multiple rationale completions, and this mixture is fine-tuned to preserve the properties of interest.

Our encoder produces a multi-resolution representation for each molecule in a fine-to-coarse fashion, from atoms to connected motifs. Each level integrates the encoding of constituents below with the graph at that level. Our autoregressive coarse-to-fine decoder adds one motif at a time, interleaving the decision of selecting a new motif with the process of resolving its attachments to the emerging molecule.

Unlike previous masked language models or the Insertion Transformer, BLM uses blanks to control which part of the sequence to expand. This fine-grained control of generation is ideal for a variety of text editing and rewriting tasks. The model can start from a single blank or partially completed text with blanks at specified locations. It iteratively determines which word to place in a blank and whether to insert new blanks, and stops generating when no blanks are left to fill. BLM can be efficiently trained using a lower bound of the marginal data likelihood, and achieves perplexity comparable to traditional left-to-right language models on the Penn Treebank and WikiText datasets. On the task of filling missing text snippets, BLM significantly outperforms all other baselines in terms of both accuracy and fluency.

Our main findings are as follows: 1) The benefit of typological information is derived from coarsely grouping languages into syntactically-homogeneous clusters rather than from learning to leverage variations along individual typological dimensions in a compositional manner; 2) Typology consistent with the actual corpus statistics yields better transfer performance; 3) Typological similarity is only a rough proxy of cross-lingual transferability with respect to parsing.',\n",
       " 'Recent developments in neural language models (LMs) have raised concerns about their potential misuse for automatically spreading misinformation. In light of these concerns, several studies have proposed to detect machine-generated fake news by capturing their stylistic differences from human-written text. These approaches, broadly termed stylometry, have found success in source attribution and misinformation detection in human-written texts. However, in this work, we show that stylometry is limited against machine-generated misinformation. While humans speak differently when trying to deceive, LMs generate stylistically consistent text, regardless of underlying motive. Thus, though stylometry can successfully prevent impersonation by identifying text provenance, it fails to distinguish legitimate LM applications from those that introduce false information. We create two benchmarks demonstrating the stylistic similarity between malicious and legitimate uses of LMs, employed in auto-completion and editing-assistance settings. Our findings highlight the need for non-stylometry approaches in detecting machine-generated misinformation, and open up the discussion on the desired evaluation benchmarks.',\n",

Meta-learning has shown strong performance in computer vision, where low-level patterns are transferable across learning tasks. However, directly applying this approach to text is challenging--lexical features highly informative for one task may be insignificant for another. Thus, rather than learning solely from words, our model also leverages their distributional signatures, which encode pertinent word occurrence patterns. Our model is trained within a meta-learning framework to map these signatures into attention scores, which are then used to weight the lexical representations of words. We demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms prototypical networks learned on lexical knowledge (Snell et al., 2017) in both few-shot text classification and relation classification by a significant margin across six benchmark datasets (20.0% on average in 1-shot classification).',\n",

However, current models struggle to maintain coherent latent spaces required to perform meaningful text manipulations via latent vector operations. Specifically, we demonstrate by example that neural encoders do not necessarily map similar sentences to nearby latent vectors. A theoretical explanation for this phenomenon establishes that high-capacity autoencoders can learn an arbitrary mapping between sequences and associated latent representations. To remedy this issue, we augment adversarial autoencoders with a denoising objective where original sentences are reconstructed from perturbed versions (referred to as DAAE). We prove that this simple modification guides the latent space geometry of the resulting model by encouraging the encoder to map similar texts to similar latent representations. In empirical comparisons with various types of autoencoders, our model provides the best trade-off between generation quality and reconstruction capacity. Moreover, the improved geometry of the DAAE latent space enables zero-shot text style transfer via simple latent vector arithmetic.',\n",

       " 'PURPOSE: The medical literature relevant to germline genetics is growing exponentially. Clinicians need tools monitoring and prioritizing the literature to understand the clinical implications of the pathogenic genetic variants. We developed and evaluated two machine learning models to classify abstracts as relevant to the penetrance (risk of cancer for germline mutation carriers) or prevalence of germline genetic mutations. METHODS: We conducted literature searches in PubMed and retrieved paper titles and abstracts to create an annotated dataset for training and evaluating the two machine learning classification models. Our first model is a support vector machine (SVM) which learns a linear decision rule based on the bag-of-ngrams representation of each title and abstract. Our second model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) which learns a complex nonlinear decision rule based on the raw title and abstract. We evaluated the performance of the two models on the classification of papers as relevant to penetrance or prevalence. RESULTS: For penetrance classification, we annotated 3740 paper titles and abstracts and used 60% for training the model, 20% for tuning the model, and 20% for evaluating the model. The SVM model achieves 89.53% accuracy (percentage of papers that were correctly classified) while the CNN model achieves 88.95 % accuracy. For prevalence classification, we annotated 3753 paper titles and abstracts. The SVM model achieves 89.14% accuracy while the CNN model achieves 89.13 % accuracy. CONCLUSION: Our models achieve high accuracy in classifying abstracts as relevant to penetrance or prevalence. By facilitating literature review, this tool could help clinicians and researchers keep abreast of the burgeoning knowledge of gene-cancer associations and keep the knowledge bases for clinical decision support tools up to date.',\n",

Two classes of models in particular have yielded promising results: neural networks applied to computed molecular fingerprints or expert-crafted descriptors, and graph convolutional neural networks that construct a learned molecular representation by operating on the graph structure of the molecule. However, recent literature has yet to clearly determine which of these two methods is superior when generalizing to new chemical space. Furthermore, prior research has rarely examined these new models in industry research settings in comparison to existing employed models. In this paper, we benchmark models extensively on 19 public and 16 proprietary industrial datasets spanning a wide variety of chemical endpoints. In addition, we introduce a graph convolutional model that consistently matches or outperforms models using fixed molecular descriptors as well as previous graph neural architectures on both public and proprietary datasets. Our empirical findings indicate that while approaches based on these representations have yet to reach the level of experimental reproducibility, our proposed model nevertheless offers significant improvements over models currently used in industrial workflows.',\n",

These phase modulations enable electron wavefront shaping and benefit electron microscopy, spectroscopy, lithography, and interferometry. However, in the fabrication of electron phase plates, the typically used focused-ion-beam-milling method limits the fabrication throughput and hence the active area of the phase plates. Here, we fabricated large-area electron phase plates with electron-beam lithography and reactive-ion-etching. The phase plates are characterized by electron diffraction in transmission electron microscopes with various electron energies, as well as diffractive imaging in a scanning electron microscope. We found the phase plates could produce a null in the center of the bright-field based on coherent interference of diffractive beams. Our work adds capabilities to the fabrication of electron phase plates. The nullification of the direct beam and the tunable diffraction efficiency demonstrated here also paves the way towards novel dark-field electron-microscopy techniques and tunable electron phase plates.',\n",
       " 'Ultrafast light-matter interactions lead to optical-field-driven photocurrents with an attosecond-level temporal response. These photocurrents can be used to detect the carrier-envelope-phase (CEP) of short optical pulses, and could be utilized to create optical-frequency, petahertz (PHz) electronics for information processing. Despite recent reports on optical-field-driven photocurrents in various nanoscale solid-state materials, little has been done in examining the large-scale integration of these devices. In this work, we demonstrate enhanced, on-chip CEP detection via optical-field-driven photocurrent in a monolithic array of electrically-connected plasmonic bow-tie nanoantennas that are contained within an area of hundreds of square microns. The technique is scalable and could potentially be used for shot-to-shot CEP tagging applications requiring orders of magnitude less pulse energy compared to alternative ionization-based techniques. Our results open new avenues for compact time-domain, on-chip CEP detection, and inform the development of integrated circuits for PHz electronics as well as integrated platforms for attosecond and strong-field science.',\n",

A critical component of such systems is the interconnect, a device or process that allows transfer of information between disparate physical media, for example, semiconductor electronics, individual atoms, light pulses in optical fiber, or microwave fields. While interconnects have been well engineered for decades in the realm of classical information technology, quantum interconnects (QuICs) present special challenges, as they must allow the transfer of fragile quantum states between different physical parts or degrees of freedom of the system. The diversity of QIT platforms (superconducting, atomic, solid-state color center, optical, etc.) that will form a quantum internet poses additional challenges. As quantum systems scale to larger size, the quantum interconnect bottleneck is imminent, and is emerging as a grand challenge for QIT. For these reasons, it is the position of the community represented by participants of the NSF workshop on Quantum Interconnects that accelerating QuIC research is crucial for sustained development of a national quantum science and technology program. Given the diversity of QIT platforms, materials used, applications, and infrastructure required, a convergent research program including partnership between academia, industry and national laboratories is required.\\n  This document is a summary from a U.S. National Science Foundation supported workshop held on 31 October - 1 November 2019 in Alexandria, VA.

The prototyping device was able to resolve up to five absorbed photons and had 16.1 ps timing jitter, <2 c.p.s. device dark count rate, $\\\\sim$86 ns reset time, and 5.6% system detection efficiency (without cavity) at 1550 nm. Its exceptional distinction between single- and two-photon responses is ideal for coincidence counting and allowed us to directly observe bunching of photon pairs from a single output port of a Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer.

Performing these operations with the conventional von Neumann architectures creates unmanageable time and power costs. Recent studies have shown that mixed-signal designs involving crossbar architectures are capable of achieving acceleration factors as high as 30,000x over the state of the art digital processors. These approaches involve utilization of non-volatile memory (NVM) elements as local processors. However, no technology has been developed to-date that can satisfy the strict device requirements for the unit cell. This paper presents the superconducting nanowire-based processing element as a cross-point device. The unit cell has many programmable non-volatile states that can be used to perform analog multiplication. Importantly, these states are intrinsically discrete due to quantization of flux, which provides symmetric switching characteristics. Operation of these devices in a crossbar is described and verified with electro-thermal circuit simulations. Finally, validation of the concept in an actual DNN training task is shown using an emulator.',\n",

For promising cryogenic computing schemes utilizing Josephson junction superconducting logic, this obstacle is exacerbated by the cryogenic system requirements that expose the technology's lack of high-density, high-speed and power-efficient memory. Here we demonstrate an array of cryogenic memory cells consisting of a non-volatile three-terminal magnetic tunnel junction element driven by the spin Hall effect, combined with a superconducting heater-cryotron bit-select element. The write energy of these memory elements is roughly 8 pJ with a bit-select element, designed to achieve a minimum overhead power consumption of about 30%. Individual magnetic memory cells measured at 4 K show reliable switching with write error rates below $10^{-6}$, and a 4x4 array can be fully addressed with bit select error rates of $10^{-6}$. This demonstration is a first step towards a full cryogenic memory architecture targeting energy and performance specifications appropriate for applications in superconducting high performance and quantum computing control systems, which require significant memory resources operating at 4 K.\",\n",
       " \"With the rising societal demand for more information-processing capacity with lower power consumption, alternative architectures inspired by the parallelism and robustness of the human brain have recently emerged as possible solutions. In particular, spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a bio-realistic approach, relying on pulses analogous to action potentials as units of information. While software encoded networks provide flexibility and precision, they are often computationally expensive. As a result, hardware SNNs based on the spiking dynamics of a device or circuit represent an increasingly appealing direction. Here, we propose to use superconducting nanowires as a platform for the development of an artificial neuron. Building on an architecture first proposed for Josephson junctions, we rely on the intrinsic nonlinearity of two coupled nanowires to generate spiking behavior, and use electrothermal circuit simulations to demonstrate that the nanowire neuron reproduces multiple characteristics of biological neurons. Furthermore, by harnessing the nonlinearity of the superconducting nanowire's inductance, we develop a design for a variable inductive synapse capable of both excitatory and inhibitory control. We demonstrate that this synapse design supports direct fanout, a feature that has been difficult to achieve in other superconducting architectures, and that the nanowire neuron's nominal energy performance is competitive with that of current technologies.\",\n",
       " 'Focused ion beam (FIB) microscopy suffers from source shot noise - random variation in the number of incident ions in any fixed dwell time - along with random variation in the number of detected secondary electrons per incident ion. This multiplicity of sources of randomness increases the variance of the measurements and thus worsens the trade-off between incident ion dose and image accuracy. Time-resolved sensing combined with maximum likelihood estimation from the resulting sets of measurements greatly reduces the effect of source shot noise. Through Fisher information analysis and Monte Carlo simulations, the reduction in mean-squared error or reduction in required dose is shown to be by a factor approximately equal to the secondary electron yield. Experiments with a helium ion microscope (HIM) are consistent with the analyses and suggest accuracy improvement for a fixed source dose, or reduced source dose for a desired imaging accuracy, by a factor of about 3.',\n",

The results from this device already place meaningful bounds on dark matter-electron interactions, including the strongest terrestrial bounds on sub-eV dark photon absorption to date. Future expected fabrication on larger scales and with lower thresholds should enable probing new territory in the direct detection landscape, establishing the complementarity of this approach to other existing proposals.',\n",

The basic setup for IFM is a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, and recent progress in nanofabricated electron diffraction gratings has made it possible to incorporate a Mach-Zehnder interferometer in a transmission-electron microscope (TEM). Therefore, the limits of performance of IFM with such an interferometer and a shot-noise limited electron source (such as that in a TEM) are of interest. In this work, we compared the error probability and sample damage for ideal IFM and classical imaging schemes, through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. We considered a sample that is either completely transparent or completely opaque at each pixel. In our analysis, we also evaluated the impact of an additional detector for scattered electrons. The additional detector resulted in reduction of error by up to an order of magnitude, for both IFM and classical schemes. We also investigated a sample re-illumination scheme based on updating priors after each round of illumination and found that this scheme further reduced error by a factor of two. Implementation of these methods is likely achievable with existing instrumentation and would result in improved resolution in low-dose electron microscopy.',\n",

Here, we present a general theoretical and experimental framework for treating nanoscale electromagnetic phenomena. The framework features surface-response functions---known as the Feibelman $d$-parameters---which reintroduce the missing electronic length scales. As a part of our framework, we establish an experimental procedure to measure these complex, dispersive surface response functions, enabled by quasi-normal-mode perturbation theory and observations of pronounced nonclassical effects---spectral shifts in excess of 30% and the breakdown of Kreibig-like broadening---in a quintessential multiscale architecture: film-coupled nanoresonators, with feature-sizes comparable to both $L_{\\\\text{e}}$ and $λ$.',\n",

       " 'The basis for superconducting electronics can broadly be divided between two technologies: the Josephson junction and the superconducting nanowire. While the Josephson junction (JJ) remains the dominant technology due to its high speed and low power dissipation, recently proposed nanowire devices offer improvements such as gain, high fanout, and compatibility with CMOS circuits. Despite these benefits, nanowire-based electronics have largely been limited to binary operations, with devices switching between the superconducting state and a high-impedance resistive state dominated by uncontrolled hotspot dynamics. Unlike the JJ, they cannot increment an output through successive switching, and their operation speeds are limited by their slow thermal reset times. Thus, there is a need for an intermediate device with the interfacing capabilities of a nanowire but a faster, moderated response allowing for modulation of the output. Here, we present a nanowire device based on controlled fluxon transport. We show that the device is capable of responding proportionally to the strength of its input, unlike other nanowire technologies. The device can be operated to produce a multilevel output with distinguishable states, which can be tuned by circuit parameters. Agreement between experimental results and electrothermal circuit simulations demonstrates that the device is classical and may be readily engineered for applications including use as a multilevel memory.',\n",

Such mirrors do not exist in electron optics, although they could be beneficial in existing techniques such as electron interferometry and holography and enable novel electron imaging and spectroscopy techniques. We propose a design for an electron beam splitter using the concept of quantum interaction-free measurement (IFM). The design combines an electron resonator with a weak phase grating. Fast switching gates allow electrons to enter and exit the resonator. While in the resonator, the phase grating transfers intensity from the direct beam into one of the weakly diffracted beams at each pass. To make the beam splitter an efficient two-port splitter, the intensity in all other diffracted beams is blocked by an aperture. The IFM principle minimizes the loss of total intensity by this aperture. We use a scattering matrix method to analyze the performance of the beam splitter, including the effects of inelastic scattering in the phase grating. This design can be generalized to beam splitters for not only electrons, but also photons, neutrons, atoms, and other quantum mechanical systems.',\n",
       " 'To analyze the switching dynamics and output performance of a superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD), the nanowire is usually modelled as an inductor in series with a time-varying resistor induced by absorption of a photon. Our recent experimental results show that, due to the effect of kinetic inductance, for a SNSPD made of a nanowire of sufficient length, its geometry length can be comparable to or even longer than the effective wavelength of frequencies contained in the output pulse. In other words, a superconducting nanowire can behave as a distributed transmission line so that the readout pulse depends on the photon detection location and the transmission line properties of the nanowire. Here, we develop a distributed model for a superconducting nanowire and apply it to simulate the output performance of a long nanowire designed into a coplanar waveguide. We compare this coplanar waveguide geometry to a conventional meander nanowire geometry. The simulation results agree well with our experimental observations. With this distributed model, we discussed the importance of microwave design of a nanowire and how impedance matching can affect the output pulse shape. We also discuss how the distributed model affects the growth and decay of the photon-triggered resistive hotspot.',\n",

We demonstrate that fluctuations in the physical parameters which determine the latency give rise to the intrinsic timing jitter. We develop a general description of latency by introducing the explicit time dependence of the internal detection efficiency. By considering the dynamic Fano fluctuations together with static spatial inhomogeneities, we study the details of the connection between latency and timing jitter. We develop both a simple phenomenological model and a more general microscopic model of detector latency and timing jitter based on the solution of the generalized time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations for the 1D hotbelt geometry. While the analytical model is sufficient for qualitative interpretation of recent data, the general approach establishes the framework for a quantitative analysis of detector latency and the fundamental limits of intrinsic timing jitter. These theoretical advances can be used to interpret the results of recent experiments measuring the dependence of detection latency and timing jitter on photon energy to the few-picosecond level.',\n",

Conventional superconducting memories use an architecture based on Josephson junctions (JJs) and have demonstrated access times less than 10 ps and power dissipation as low as $10^{-19}$ J. However, their scalability has been slow to develop due to the challenges in reducing the dimensions of JJs and minimizing the area of the superconducting loops. In addition to the memory itself, complex readout circuits require additional JJs and inductors for coupling signals, increasing the overall area. Here, we have demonstrated a superconducting memory based solely on lithographic nanowires. The small dimensions of the nanowire ensure that the device can be fabricated in a dense area in multiple layers, while the high kinetic inductance makes the loop essentially independent of geometric inductance, allowing it to be scaled down without sacrificing performance. The memory is operated by a group of nanowire cryotrons patterned alongside the storage loop, enabling us to reduce the entire memory cell to 3 μm $\\\\times $ 7 μm in our proof-of-concept device.

Two superconducting nanowires developed for use as single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are embedded as the inductive (L) component in resonant inductor/capacitor (LC) circuits coupled to a microwave transmission line. The capacitors are low loss commercial chip capacitors and limit the internal quality factor of the resonators to approximately $Q_i = 170$. The resonator quality factor, $Q_r \\\\simeq 23$, is dominated by the coupling to the feedline and limits the detection bandwidth to on the order of 1MHz. When operated in KID mode, the detectors are AC biased with tones at their resonant frequencies of 45.85 and 91.81MHz. In the low-bias, standard KID mode, a single photon produces a hot spot that does not turn an entire section of the line normal but only increases the kinetic inductance. In the high-bias, critical KID mode, a photon event turns a section of the line normal and the resonance is destroyed until the normal region is dissipated. When operated as an SPD in Geiger mode, the resonators are DC biased through cryogenic bias tees and each photon produces a sharp voltage step followed by a ringdown signal at the resonant frequency of the detector which is converted to a standard pulse with an envelop detector. We show that AC biasing in the critical KID mode is inferior to the sensitivity achieved in DC-biased SPD mode due to the small fraction of time spent near the critical current with an AC bias.',\n",

In this paper, we present the experimental observation of visible light emission from low-energy free electrons interacting with nanoscale periodic surfaces through the Smith-Purcell (SP) effect. SP radiation is emitted when electrons pass in close proximity over a periodic structure, inducing collective charge motion or dipole excitations near the surface, thereby giving rise to electromagnetic radiation. We demonstrate a controlled emission of SP light from nanoscale gold gratings with periodicity as small as 50 nm, enabling the observation of visible SP radiation by low energy electrons (1.5 to 6 keV), an order of magnitude lower than previously reported. We study the emission wavelength and intensity dependence on the grating pitch and electron energy, showing agreement between experiment and theory. Further reduction of structure periodicity should enable the production of SP-based devices that operate with even slower electrons that allow an even smaller footprint and facilitate the investigation of quantum effects for light generation in nanoscale devices.

In this paper, we use resistive shunting to control the nonlinear heating of a superconducting nanowire and compare the resulting dynamics to those observed in Josephson junctions. We show that interaction of the hotspot growth with the external shunt produces high frequency relaxation oscillations with similar behavior as observed in Josephson junctions due to their rapid time constants and ability to be modulated by a weak periodic signal. In particular, we use a microwave drive to pull and mix the oscillation frequency, resulting in phase locked features that resemble the AC Josephson effect.

Moreover, understanding the nanoscale behavior of superconductivity is significant for revealing the onset of collective-electron behavior in nature. Nevertheless, the limited number of accessible superconductors restricts availability of the superconducting properties, encumbering the realization of their potential. Superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) sense single-IR photons faster and more efficient with respect to competing technologies. However, these advantageous properties are material-dependent causing an undesirable speed-efficiency payoff. Usually, SNSPDs based on granular materials are faster, while those based on amorphous materials are more efficient. Here we optimized ultrathin films of granular NbN on SiO2 and of amorphous W5Si3. We showed that hybrid superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) made of 2-nm-thick W5Si3 films over 2-nm-thick NbN films exhibit advantageous coexistence of timing (< 5-ns reset time and 52-ps timing jitter) and efficiency (> 96% quantum efficiency) performance. We propose that the governing mechanism of this hybridization is the presence of a dual superconducting behavior: native superconductivity of each of the films and superconductivity that is induced from the neighboring film via the proximity effect. In addition to improvement in SNSPDs performance, our results suggest that such hybridization can expand the range of available superconducting properties, impacting nano-superconducting technologies.

       " 'Detection jitter quantifies variance introduced by the detector in the determination of photon arrival time. It is a crucial performance parameter for systems using superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs). In this work, we have demonstrated that the detection timing jitter is limited in part by the spatial variation of photon detection events along the length of the wire. This distribution causes the generated electrical pulses to arrive at the readout at varied times. We define this jitter source as geometric jitter since it is related to the length and area of the SNSPD. To characterize the geometric jitter, we have constructed a novel differential cryogenic readout with less than 7 ps of electronic jitter that can amplify the pulses generated from the two ends of an SNSPD. By differencing the measured arrival times of the two electrical pulses, we were able to partially cancel out the difference of the propagation times and thus reduce the uncertainty of the photon arrival time. Our experimental data indicates that the variation of the differential propagation time was a few ps for a 3 μm x 3 μm device while it increased up to 50 ps for a 20 μm x 20 μm device. In a 20 μm x 20 μm large SNSPD, we achieved a 20% reduction in the overall detection timing jitter for detecting telecom-wavelength photons by using the differential cryogenic readout. The geometric jitter hypothesis was further confirmed by studying jitter in devices that consisted of long wires with 1-μm-long narrowed regions used for sensing photons.',\n",
       " 'We describe a superconducting three-terminal device that uses a simple geometric effect known as current crowding to sense the flow of current and actuate a readout signal. The device consists of a \"Y\"-shaped current combiner, with two currents (sense and bias) entering through the top arms of the \"Y\", intersecting, and then exiting through the bottom leg of the \"Y\"\\'. This geometry--mixing two inputs at a sharp intersection point--takes its inspiration from Y-shaped combiners in fluid flow systems, where variations in the input pressures can produce at turbulence and mixing at the intersection. When current is added to or removed from one of the arms (the sense arm), the superconducting critical current in the other arm (the bias arm) is modulated. The current in the sense arm can thus be determined by measuring the critical current of the bias arm. The dependence of the bias critical current on the sense current is possible because current crowding causes the sense current to interact locally with the bias arm. Measurement of the critical current in the bias arm does not break the superconducting state of the sense arm or of the bottom leg, and thus the signal to be sensed is fully restored after the measurement process. This device thus has potential for broad applicability across superconducting technologies and materials.',\n",

By appropriately designing the nanowire's local electromagnetic environment so that the nanowire guides microwave plasmons, the propagating voltages signals generated by a photon-detection event were slowed down to ~ 2% of the speed of light. As a result, the time difference between arrivals of the signals at the two ends of the nanowire naturally encoded the position and time of absorption of the photon. Thus, with only two readout lines, we demonstrated that a 19.7-mm-long nanowire meandered across an area of 286 μm * 193 μm was capable of resolving ~590 effective pixels while simultaneously recording the arrival times of photons with a temporal resolution of 50 ps.

This resonance sets the upper frequency limit for these nanowires as inductive elements. Fitting simulations to the measured resonance enables a precise determination of the nanowire's complex sheet impedance at the resonance frequency. The real part is a measure of dissipation, while the imaginary part is dominated by kinetic inductance. We characterize the dependence of the sheet resistance and sheet inductance on both temperature and current and compare the results to recent theoretical predictions for disordered superconductors. These results can aid in the understanding of high frequency devices based on superconducting nanowires. They may also lead to the development of novel superconducting devices such as ultra-compact resonators and slow-wave structures.\",\n",

       " 'One of the astounding consequences of quantum mechanics is that it allows the detection of a target using an incident probe, with only a low probability of interaction of the probe and the target. This \\'quantum weirdness\\' could be applied in the field of electron microscopy to generate images of beam-sensitive specimens with substantially reduced damage to the specimen. A reduction of beam-induced damage to specimens is especially of great importance if it can enable imaging of biological specimens with atomic resolution. Following a recent suggestion that interaction-free measurements are possible with electrons, we now analyze the difficulties of actually building an atomic resolution interaction-free electron microscope, or \"quantum electron microscope\". A quantum electron microscope would require a number of unique components not found in conventional transmission electron microscopes. These components include a coherent electron-beam splitter or two-state-coupler, and a resonator structure to allow each electron to interrogate the specimen multiple times, thus supporting high success probabilities for interaction-free detection of the specimen. Different system designs are presented here, which are based on four different choices of two-state-couplers: a thin crystal, a grating mirror, a standing light wave and an electro-dynamical pseudopotential. Challenges for the detailed electron optical design are identified as future directions for development. While it is concluded that it should be possible to build an atomic resolution quantum electron microscope, we have also identified a number of hurdles to the development of such a microscope and further theoretical investigations that will be required to enable a complete interpretation of the images produced by such a microscope.',\n",

However, the arrangement and orientation of single biomolecules on substrates has been less investigated. Here, we examined the arrangement and orientation of two rod-like coiled-coil proteins, cortexillin and tropomyosin, around patterned gold nanostructures. The high aspect ratio of the coiled coils made it possible to study their orientations and to pursue a strategy of protein orientation via two-point attachment. The proteins were anchored to the surfaces using thiol groups, and the number of cysteine residues in tropomyosin was varied to test how this variation affected the structure and arrangement of the surface-attached proteins. Molecular dynamics studies were used to interpret the observed positional distributions. Based on initial studies of protein attachment to gold post structures, two 31-nm-long tropomyosin molecules were aligned between the two sidewalls of a trench with a width of 68 nm. Because the approach presented in this study uses one of twenty natural amino acids, this method provides a convenient way to pattern biomolecules on substrates using standard chemistry.',\n",

They allow an inherent competition between disorder and superconductivity, which in turn enables the intriguing superconducting-to-insulator transition and believed to facilitate the comprehension of high-Tc superconductivity.

Consequently, the absence of an established universal relationships between critical temperature ($T_c$), film thickness ($d$) and sheet resistance ($R_s$) hinders both our understanding of the onset of the superconductivity and the development of miniaturised superconducting devices. We report that in thin films, superconductivity scales as $d^.$$T_c(R_s)$. We demonstrated this scaling by analysing the data published over the past 46 years for different materials (and facilitated this database for further analysis).

Here we present a nanowire-based superconducting electronic device, which we call the nanocryotron (nTron), that does not rely on Josephson junctions and can be patterned from a single thin film of superconducting material with conventional electron-beam lithography. The nTron is a 3-terminal, T-shaped planar device with a gain of ~20 that is capable of driving impedances of more than 100 kΩ, and operates in typical ambient magnetic fields at temperatures of 4.2K. The device uses a localized, Joule-heated hotspot formed in the gate to modulate current flow in a perpendicular superconducting channel. We have characterized the nTron, matched it to a theoretical framework, and applied it both as a digital logic element in a half-adder circuit, and as a digital amplifier for superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors pulses. The nTron has immediate applications in classical and quantum communications, photon sensing and astronomy, and its performance characteristics make it compatible with existing superconducting technologies. Furthermore, because the hotspot effect occurs in all known superconductors, we expect the design to be extensible to other materials, providing a path to digital logic, switching, and amplification in high-temperature superconductors.',\n",

We define the critical current as the current that reduces the Gibbs free-energy barrier to zero. We show that current crowding, which occurs whenever the current rounds a sharp turn, tends to reduce the critical current, but we also show that when the radius of curvature is less than the coherence length this effect is partially compensated by a radius-of-curvature effect. We propose several patterns with rounded corners to avoid critical-current reduction due to current crowding. These results are relevant to superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, where they suggest a means of improving the bias conditions and reducing dark counts.

We also measured devices with lower fill-factors and narrower wires that were five times more sensitive to parallel-polarized photons than perpendicular-polarized photons. We developed a numerical model that predicts the absorptance of our structures. We also used our measurements, coupled with measurements of device detection efficiencies, to determine the probability of photon detection after an absorption event. We found that, remarkably, absorbed parallel-polarized photons were more likely to result in detection events than perpendicular-polarized photons, and we present a hypothesis that qualitatively explains this result.

Conventionally, spectra are probed via frequency spectroscopy whereby the frequency νof a harmonic driving field is varied to fulfill the conditions ΔE = h ν, where the driving field is resonant with the level separation ΔE (h is Planck's constant). Although this technique has been successfully employed in a variety of physical systems, including natural and artificial atoms and molecules, its application is not universally straightforward, and becomes extremely challenging for frequencies in the range of 10's and 100's of gigahertz. Here we demonstrate an alternative approach, whereby a harmonic driving field sweeps the atom through its energy-level avoided crossings at a fixed frequency, surmounting many of the limitations of the conventional approach. Spectroscopic information is obtained from the amplitude dependence of the system response. The resulting ``spectroscopy diamonds'' contain interference patterns and population inversion that serve as a fingerprint of the atom's spectrum.

The classical aggregation framework is obtained when $V\\\\equiv0$, but our scheme works best when $V$ is a known reasonably good approximation to the optimal cost function $J^*$.\\n  When $V$ is equal to the cost function $J_μ$ of some known policy $μ$ and there is only one aggregate state, our scheme is equivalent to the rollout algorithm based on $μ$ (i.e., the result of a single policy improvement starting with the policy $μ$). When $V=J_μ$ and there are multiple aggregate states, our aggregation approach can be used as a more powerful form of improvement of $μ$. Thus, when combined with an approximate policy evaluation scheme, our approach can form the basis for a new and enhanced form of approximate policy iteration.\\n  When $V$ is a generic bias function, our scheme is equivalent to approximation in value space with lookahead function equal to $V$ plus a local correction within each aggregate state. The local correction levels are obtained by solving a low-dimensional aggregate DP problem, yielding an arbitrarily close approximation to $J^*$, when the number of aggregate states is sufficiently large. Except for the bias function, the aggregate DP problem is similar to the one of the classical aggregation framework, and its algorithmic solution by simulation or other methods is nearly identical to one for classical aggregation, assuming values of $V$ are available when needed.',\n",

Another benefit is the potential integration into the proximal algorithmic context of several new ideas that have emerged in the DP/RL context. We discuss some of the possibilities, and in particular, algorithms that project each proximal iterate onto the subspace spanned by a small number of basis functions, using low-dimensional calculations and simulation. A third benefit is that insights and analysis from proximal algorithms can be brought to bear on the enhancement of TD methods.\\n  The linear fixed point methodology can be extended to nonlinear fixed point problems involving a contraction, thus providing guaranteed and potentially substantial acceleration of the proximal and forward backward splitting algorithms at no extra cost. Moreover, the connection of proximal and TD methods can be extended to nonlinear (nondifferentiable) fixed point problems through new proximal-like algorithms that involve successive linearization, similar to policy iteration in DP.',\n",

As with other highly variable datasets, traditional segmentation models have poor generalizability as they rely on hand-crafted features; thus, manual annotation of liver stage malaria images remains standard. To address this need, we develop a convolutional neural network architecture that utilizes spatial dropout sampling for parasite segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation in images of liver stage malaria.

Although this verification problem is NP-complete in general, we give a more precise complexity characterization. We show that there is a simple linear time algorithm for verifying a single tree, and for tree ensembles, the verification problem can be cast as a max-clique problem on a multi-partite graph with bounded boxicity. For low dimensional problems when boxicity can be viewed as constant, this reformulation leads to a polynomial time algorithm. For general problems, by exploiting the boxicity of the graph, we develop an efficient multi-level verification algorithm that can give tight lower bounds on the robustness of decision tree ensembles, while allowing iterative improvement and any-time termination.

In our paper, we shed some lights on the practicality and the hardness of adversarial training by showing that the effectiveness (robustness on test set) of adversarial training has a strong correlation with the distance between a test point and the manifold of training data embedded by the network. Test examples that are relatively far away from this manifold are more likely to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Consequentially, an adversarial training based defense is susceptible to a new class of attacks, the \"blind-spot attack\", where the input images reside in \"blind-spots\" (low density regions) of the empirical distribution of training data but is still on the ground-truth data manifold. For MNIST, we found that these blind-spots can be easily found by simply scaling and shifting image pixel values. Most importantly, for large datasets with high dimensional and complex data manifold (CIFAR, ImageNet, etc), the existence of blind-spots in adversarial training makes defending on any valid test examples difficult due to the curse of dimensionality and the scarcity of training data. Additionally, we find that blind-spots also exist on provable defenses including (Wong & Kolter, 2018) and (Sinha et al., 2018) because these trainable robustness certificates can only be practically optimized on a limited set of training data.',\n",

All previous reductions to sparse PCA either fail to show tight computational lower bounds matching existing algorithms or show lower bounds for formulations of sparse PCA other than its canonical generative model, the spiked covariance model.

Specifically, when only given the PC conjecture up to $K = o(N^α)$ where $α< 1/2$, there is no sparsity level $k$ at which these lower bounds remain tight. If $α\\\\le 1/3$ these reductions fail to even show the existence of a statistical-computational tradeoff at any sparsity $k$.

A variety of algorithms have been proposed for both SPCA and SLR, but an explicit connection between the two had not been made. We show how to efficiently transform a black-box solver for SLR into an algorithm for SPCA: assuming the SLR solver satisfies prediction error guarantees achieved by existing efficient algorithms such as those based on the Lasso, the SPCA algorithm derived from it achieves near state of the art guarantees for testing and for support recovery for the single spiked covariance model as obtained by the current best polynomialtime algorithms. Our reduction not only highlights the inherent similarity between the two problems, but also, from a practical standpoint, allows one to obtain a collection of algorithms for SPCA directly from known algorithms for SLR.

While there are algorithms with provable guarantees for learning undirected graphical models in a variety of settings, there has been much less progress in the important scenario when there are latent variables. Here we study Restricted Boltzmann Machines (or RBMs), which are a popular model with wide-ranging applications in dimensionality reduction, collaborative filtering, topic modeling, feature extraction and deep learning.\\n  The main message of our paper is a strong dichotomy in the feasibility of learning RBMs, depending on the nature of the interactions between variables: ferromagnetic models can be learned efficiently, while general models cannot. In particular, we give a simple greedy algorithm based on influence maximization to learn ferromagnetic RBMs with bounded degree. In fact, we learn a description of the distribution on the observed variables as a Markov Random Field. Our analysis is based on tools from mathematical physics that were developed to show the concavity of magnetization. Our algorithm extends straighforwardly to general ferromagnetic Ising models with latent variables.\\n  Conversely, we show that even for a contant number of latent variables with constant degree, without ferromagneticity the problem is as hard as sparse parity with noise. This hardness result is based on a sharp and surprising characterization of the representational power of bounded degree RBMs: the distribution on their observed variables can simulate any bounded order MRF. This result is of independent interest since RBMs are the building blocks of deep belief networks.',\n",

The restriction to Hamming spheres is necessary, since otherwise any scalar statistic is useless without explicit knowledge of the temperature parameter. At the same time, this restriction radically changes the behavior of the functions under consideration, resulting in a much smaller variance than in the independent setting; this makes it hard to directly apply standard methods (i.e., Stein's method) for concentration of weakly dependent variables.

Each user may be recommended a given item at most once. A latent variable model specifies the user preferences: both users and items are clustered into types. All users of a given type have identical preferences for the items, and similarly, items of a given type are either all liked or all disliked by a given user. We assume that the matrix encoding the preferences of each user type for each item type is randomly generated; in this way, the model captures structure in both the item and user spaces, the amount of structure depending on the number of each of the types. The measure of performance of the recommendation system is the expected number of disliked recommendations per user, defined as expected regret. We propose two algorithms inspired by user-user and item-item collaborative filtering (CF), modified to explicitly make exploratory recommendations, and prove performance guarantees in terms of their expected regret. For two regimes of model parameters, with structure only in item space or only in user space, we prove information-theoretic lower bounds on regret that match our upper bounds up to logarithmic factors. Our analysis elucidates system operating regimes in which existing CF algorithms are nearly optimal.\",\n",

This leads to an unconditional computational lower bound of $Ω(p^{d/2})$ for learning general graphical models on $p$ nodes of maximum degree $d$, for the class of so-called statistical algorithms recently introduced by Feldman et al (2013). The lower bound suggests that the $O(p^d)$ runtime required to exhaustively search over neighborhoods cannot be significantly improved without restricting the class of models.\\n  Aside from structural assumptions on the graph such as it being a tree, hypertree, tree-like, etc., many recent papers on structure learning assume that the model has the correlation decay property.

Our second set of results gives a class of repelling (antiferromagnetic) models that have the opposite behavior: very strong interaction allows efficient learning in time $O(p^2)$.

We address this theoretical gap by introducing a model for online recommendation systems, cast item recommendation under the model as a learning problem, and analyze the performance of a cosine-similarity collaborative filtering method. In our model, each of $n$ users either likes or dislikes each of $m$ items. We assume there to be $k$ types of users, and all the users of a given type share a common string of probabilities determining the chance of liking each item. At each time step, we recommend an item to each user, where a key distinction from related bandit literature is that once a user consumes an item (e.g., watches a movie), then that item cannot be recommended to the same user again.

However, these methods require repeatedly re-fitting the model with different weighted versions of the original dataset, which can be prohibitively time-consuming. For sufficiently regular optimization problems the optimum depends smoothly on the data weights, and so the process of repeatedly re-fitting can be approximated with a Taylor series that can be often evaluated relatively quickly. The first-order approximation is known as the \"infinitesimal jackknife\" in the statistics literature and has been the subject of recent interest in machine learning for approximate CV. In this work, we consider high-order approximations, which we call the \"higher-order infinitesimal jackknife\" (HOIJ). Under mild regularity conditions, we provide a simple recursive procedure to compute approximations of all orders with finite-sample accuracy bounds. Additionally, we show that the HOIJ can be efficiently computed even in high dimensions using forward-mode automatic differentiation. We show that a linear approximation with bootstrap weights approximation is equivalent to those provided by asymptotic normal approximations. Consequently, the HOIJ opens up the possibility of enjoying higher-order accuracy properties of the bootstrap using local approximations. Consistency of the HOIJ for leave-one-out CV under different asymptotic regimes follows as corollaries from our finite-sample bounds under additional regularity assumptions.

Thus there is the need for a distributional assumption that is both weak enough to hold in practice, and strong enough to guarantee a useful underlying representation. We introduce a relaxed notion of local exchangeability---where swapping data associated with nearby covariates causes a bounded change in the distribution. Next, we prove that locally exchangeable processes correspond to independent observations from an underlying measure-valued stochastic process, showing that de Finetti's theorem is robust to perturbation and providing further justification for the Bayesian modelling approach.

However, synthesizing this information to reconstruct dynamic biological phenomena from data that are noisy, heterogenous, and sparse---and from processes that may unfold asynchronously---poses a complex computational and statistical challenge. Here, we develop a full generative model for probabilistically reconstructing trees of cellular differentiation from single-cell RNA-seq data. Specifically, we extend the framework of the classical Dirichlet diffusion tree to simultaneously infer branch topology and latent cell states along continuous trajectories over the full tree. In tandem, we construct a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler that interleaves Metropolis-Hastings and message passing to leverage model structure for efficient inference. Finally, we demonstrate that these techniques can recover latent trajectories from simulated single-cell transcriptomes. While this work is motivated by cellular differentiation, we derive a tractable model that provides flexible densities for any data (coupled with an appropriate noise model) that arise from continuous evolution along a latent nonparametric tree.',\n",
       " 'A central question in many probabilistic clustering problems is how many distinct clusters are present in a particular dataset. A Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) model addresses this question by placing a generative process on cluster assignment. However, like all Bayesian approaches, BNP requires the specification of a prior. In practice, it is important to quantitatively establish that the prior is not too informative, particularly when the particular form of the prior is chosen for mathematical convenience rather than because of a considered subjective belief.\\n  We derive local sensitivity measures for a truncated variational Bayes (VB) approximation and approximate nonlinear dependence of a VB optimum on prior parameters using a local Taylor series approximation. Using a stick-breaking representation of a Dirichlet process, we consider perturbations both to the scalar concentration parameter and to the functional form of the stick- breaking distribution.\\n  Unlike previous work on local Bayesian sensitivity for BNP, we pay special attention to the ability of our sensitivity measures to extrapolate to different priors, rather than treating the sensitivity as a measure of robustness per se. Extrapolation motivates the use of multiplicative perturbations to the functional form of the prior for VB. Additionally, we linearly approximate only the computationally intensive part of inference -- the optimization of the global parameters -- and retain the nonlinearity of easily computed quantities as functions of the global parameters.\\n  We apply our methods to estimate sensitivity of the expected number of distinct clusters present in the Iris dataset to the BNP prior specification. We evaluate the accuracy of our approximations by comparing to the much more expensive process of re-fitting the model.',\n",
       " 'Kernel methods offer the flexibility to learn complex relationships in modern, large data sets while enjoying strong theoretical guarantees on quality. Unfortunately, these methods typically require cubic running time in the data set size, a prohibitive cost in the large-data setting. Random feature maps (RFMs) and the Nystrom method both consider low-rank approximations to the kernel matrix as a potential solution. But, in order to achieve desirable theoretical guarantees, the former may require a prohibitively large number of features J+, and the latter may be prohibitively expensive for high-dimensional problems. We propose to combine the simplicity and generality of RFMs with a data-dependent feature selection scheme to achieve desirable theoretical approximation properties of Nystrom with just O(log J+) features. Our key insight is to begin with a large set of random features, then reduce them to a small number of weighted features in a data-dependent, computationally efficient way, while preserving the statistical guarantees of using the original large set of features. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method with theory and experiments--including on a data set with over 50 million observations. In particular, we show that our method achieves small kernel matrix approximation error and better test set accuracy with provably fewer random features than state-of-the-art methods.',\n",
       " 'Bayesian inference typically requires the computation of an approximation to the posterior distribution. An important requirement for an approximate Bayesian inference algorithm is to output high-accuracy posterior mean and uncertainty estimates. Classical Monte Carlo methods, particularly Markov Chain Monte Carlo, remain the gold standard for approximate Bayesian inference because they have a robust finite-sample theory and reliable convergence diagnostics. However, alternative methods, which are more scalable or apply to problems where Markov Chain Monte Carlo cannot be used, lack the same finite-data approximation theory and tools for evaluating their accuracy. In this work, we develop a flexible new approach to bounding the error of mean and uncertainty estimates of scalable inference algorithms. Our strategy is to control the estimation errors in terms of Wasserstein distance, then bound the Wasserstein distance via a generalized notion of Fisher distance. Unlike computing the Wasserstein distance, which requires access to the normalized posterior distribution, the Fisher distance is tractable to compute because it requires access only to the gradient of the log posterior density. We demonstrate the usefulness of our Fisher distance approach by deriving bounds on the Wasserstein error of the Laplace approximation and Hilbert coresets. We anticipate that our approach will be applicable to many other approximate inference methods such as the integrated Laplace approximation, variational inference, and approximate Bayesian computation',\n",

We develop an approach to scalable approximate GP regression with finite-data guarantees on the accuracy of pointwise posterior mean and variance estimates. Our main contribution is a novel objective for approximate inference in the nonparametric setting: the preconditioned Fisher (pF) divergence. We show that unlike the Kullback--Leibler divergence (used in variational inference), the pF divergence bounds the 2-Wasserstein distance, which in turn provides tight bounds the pointwise difference of the mean and variance functions. We demonstrate that, for sparse GP likelihood approximations, we can minimize the pF divergence efficiently. Our experiments show that optimizing the pF divergence has the same computational requirements as variational sparse GPs while providing comparable empirical performance--in addition to our novel finite-data quality guarantees.',\n",
       " 'The error or variability of machine learning algorithms is often assessed by repeatedly re-fitting a model with different weighted versions of the observed data. The ubiquitous tools of cross-validation (CV) and the bootstrap are examples of this technique. These methods are powerful in large part due to their model agnosticism but can be slow to run on modern, large data sets due to the need to repeatedly re-fit the model. In this work, we use a linear approximation to the dependence of the fitting procedure on the weights, producing results that can be faster than repeated re-fitting by an order of magnitude. This linear approximation is sometimes known as the \"infinitesimal jackknife\" in the statistics literature, where it is mostly used as a theoretical tool to prove asymptotic results. We provide explicit finite-sample error bounds for the infinitesimal jackknife in terms of a small number of simple, verifiable assumptions. Our results apply whether the weights and data are stochastic or deterministic, and so can be used as a tool for proving the accuracy of the infinitesimal jackknife on a wide variety of problems. As a corollary, we state mild regularity conditions under which our approximation consistently estimates true leave-$k$-out cross-validation for any fixed $k$. These theoretical results, together with modern automatic differentiation software, support the application of the infinitesimal jackknife to a wide variety of practical problems in machine learning, providing a \"Swiss Army infinitesimal jackknife\".

       " 'Learning a Bayesian network (BN) from data can be useful for decision-making or discovering causal relationships. However, traditional methods often fail in modern applications, which exhibit a larger number of observed variables than data points. The resulting uncertainty about the underlying network as well as the desire to incorporate prior information recommend a Bayesian approach to learning the BN, but the highly combinatorial structure of BNs poses a striking challenge for inference. The current state-of-the-art methods such as order MCMC are faster than previous methods but prevent the use of many natural structural priors and still have running time exponential in the maximum indegree of the true directed acyclic graph (DAG) of the BN. We here propose an alternative posterior approximation based on the observation that, if we incorporate empirical conditional independence tests, we can focus on a high-probability DAG associated with each order of the vertices. We show that our method allows the desired flexibility in prior specification, removes timing dependence on the maximum indegree and yields provably good posterior approximations; in addition, we show that it achieves superior accuracy, scalability, and sampler mixing on several datasets.',\n",

But modern algorithms for approximate Bayesian posterior inference often sacrifice accurate posterior uncertainty estimation in the pursuit of scalability. This work shows that previous Bayesian coreset construction algorithms---which build a small, weighted subset of the data that approximates the full dataset---are no exception. We demonstrate that these algorithms scale the coreset log-likelihood suboptimally, resulting in underestimated posterior uncertainty. To address this shortcoming, we develop greedy iterative geodesic ascent (GIGA), a novel algorithm for Bayesian coreset construction that scales the coreset log-likelihood optimally. GIGA provides geometric decay in posterior approximation error as a function of coreset size, and maintains the fast running time of its predecessors. The paper concludes with validation of GIGA on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating that it reduces posterior approximation error by orders of magnitude compared with previous coreset constructions.',\n",

Often used as a preliminary step for dimensionality reduction or to facilitate interpretation, finding robust and stable clusters is often crucial for appropriate for downstream analysis. In the present work, we consider Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) models, a particularly popular set of Bayesian models for clustering due to their flexibility. Because of its complexity, the Bayesian posterior often cannot be computed exactly, and approximations must be employed. Mean-field variational Bayes forms a posterior approximation by solving an optimization problem and is widely used due to its speed. An exact BNP posterior might vary dramatically when presented with different data. As such, stability and robustness of the clustering should be assessed.\\n  A popular mean to assess stability is to apply the bootstrap by resampling the data, and rerun the clustering for each simulated data set. The time cost is thus often very expensive, especially for the sort of exploratory analysis where clustering is typically used. We propose to use a fast and automatic approximation to the full bootstrap called the \"linear bootstrap\", which can be seen by local data perturbation. In this work, we demonstrate how to apply this idea to a data analysis pipeline, consisting of an MFVB approximation to a BNP clustering posterior of time course gene expression data. We show that using auto-differentiation tools, the necessary calculations can be done automatically, and that the linear bootstrap is a fast but approximate alternative to the bootstrap.',\n",
       " 'The automation of posterior inference in Bayesian data analysis has enabled experts and nonexperts alike to use more sophisticated models, engage in faster exploratory modeling and analysis, and ensure experimental reproducibility. However, standard automated posterior inference algorithms are not tractable at the scale of massive modern datasets, and modifications to make them so are typically model-specific, require expert tuning, and can break theoretical guarantees on inferential quality. Building on the Bayesian coresets framework, this work instead takes advantage of data redundancy to shrink the dataset itself as a preprocessing step, providing fully-automated, scalable Bayesian inference with theoretical guarantees. We begin with an intuitive reformulation of Bayesian coreset construction as sparse vector sum approximation, and demonstrate that its automation and performance-based shortcomings arise from the use of the supremum norm. To address these shortcomings we develop Hilbert coresets, i.e., Bayesian coresets constructed under a norm induced by an inner-product on the log-likelihood function space. We propose two Hilbert coreset construction algorithms---one based on importance sampling, and one based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm---along with theoretical guarantees on approximation quality as a function of coreset size. Since the exact computation of the proposed inner-products is model-specific, we automate the construction with a random finite-dimensional projection of the log-likelihood functions. The resulting automated coreset construction algorithm is simple to implement, and experiments on a variety of models with real and synthetic datasets show that it provides high-quality posterior approximations and a significant reduction in the computational cost of inference.',\n",

Probabilistic approaches, particularly Bayesian ones, allow coherent estimates of uncertainty, incorporation of prior information, and sharing of power across experiments via hierarchical models. In practice, however, the approximate Bayesian methods necessary for inference have either failed to scale to large data sets or failed to provide theoretical guarantees on the quality of inference. We propose a new approach based on constructing polynomial approximate sufficient statistics for GLMs (PASS-GLM). We demonstrate that our method admits a simple algorithm as well as trivial streaming and distributed extensions that do not compound error across computations. We provide theoretical guarantees on the quality of point (MAP) estimates, the approximate posterior, and posterior mean and uncertainty estimates.

However, even when MFVB provides accurate posterior means for certain parameters, it often mis-estimates variances and covariances. Furthermore, prior robustness measures have remained undeveloped for MFVB. By deriving a simple formula for the effect of infinitesimal model perturbations on MFVB posterior means, we provide both improved covariance estimates and local robustness measures for MFVB, thus greatly expanding the practical usefulness of MFVB posterior approximations. The estimates for MFVB posterior covariances rely on a result from the classical Bayesian robustness literature relating derivatives of posterior expectations to posterior covariances and include the Laplace approximation as a special case. Our key condition is that the MFVB approximation provides good estimates of a select subset of posterior means---an assumption that has been shown to hold in many practical settings. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our methods are simple, general, and fast, providing accurate posterior uncertainty estimates and robustness measures with runtimes that can be an order of magnitude faster than MCMC.',\n",

We present an alternative notion of exchangeability for random graphs, which we call edge exchangeability, in which the distribution of a graph sequence is invariant to the order of the edges. We demonstrate that edge-exchangeable models, unlike models that are traditionally vertex exchangeable, can exhibit sparsity. To do so, we outline a general framework for graph generative models; by contrast to the pioneering work of Caron and Fox (2015), models within our framework are stationary across steps of the graph sequence. In particular, our model grows the graph by instantiating more latent atoms of a single random measure as the dataset size increases, rather than adding new atoms to the measure.',\n",
       " 'In Bayesian analysis, the posterior follows from the data and a choice of a prior and a likelihood. One hopes that the posterior is robust to reasonable variation in the choice of prior, since this choice is made by the modeler and is often somewhat subjective. A different, equally subjectively plausible choice of prior may result in a substantially different posterior, and so different conclusions drawn from the data. Were this to be the case, our conclusions would not be robust to the choice of prior. To determine whether our model is robust, we must quantify how sensitive our posterior is to perturbations of our prior. Despite the importance of the problem and a considerable body of literature, generic, easy-to-use methods to quantify Bayesian robustness are still lacking.\\n  Abstract In this paper, we demonstrate that powerful measures of robustness can be easily calculated from Variational Bayes (VB) approximate posteriors. We begin with local robustness, which measures the effect of infinitesimal changes to the prior on a posterior mean of interest. In particular, we show that the influence function of Gustafson (2012) has a simple, easy-to-calculate closed form expression for VB approximations. We then demonstrate how local robustness measures can be inadequate for non-local prior changes, such as replacing one prior entirely with another. We propose a simple approximate non-local robustness measure and demonstrate its effectiveness on a simulated data set.',\n",
       " 'Variational inference (VI) provides fast approximations of a Bayesian posterior in part because it formulates posterior approximation as an optimization problem: to find the closest distribution to the exact posterior over some family of distributions. For practical reasons, the family of distributions in VI is usually constrained so that it does not include the exact posterior, even as a limit point. Thus, no matter how long VI is run, the resulting approximation will not approach the exact posterior. We propose to instead consider a more flexible approximating family consisting of all possible finite mixtures of a parametric base distribution (e.g., Gaussian). For efficient inference, we borrow ideas from gradient boosting to develop an algorithm we call boosting variational inference (BVI). BVI iteratively improves the current approximation by mixing it with a new component from the base distribution family and thereby yields progressively more accurate posterior approximations as more computing time is spent. Unlike a number of common VI variants including mean-field VI, BVI is able to capture multimodality, general posterior covariance, and nonstandard posterior shapes.',\n",

In this work, we develop the analogous de Finetti representation and exchangeable trait probability function (ETPF) for trait allocations, along with a characterization of all trait allocations with an ETPF. Unlike previous feature allocation characterizations, our proofs fully capture single-occurrence \"dust\" groups. We further introduce a novel constrained version of the ETPF that we use to establish an intuitive connection between the probability functions for clustering, feature allocations, and trait allocations.

Standard Bayesian inference algorithms are computationally expensive, however, making their direct application to large datasets difficult or infeasible. Recent work on scaling Bayesian inference has focused on modifying the underlying algorithms to, for example, use only a random data subsample at each iteration. We leverage the insight that data is often redundant to instead obtain a weighted subset of the data (called a coreset) that is much smaller than the original dataset. We can then use this small coreset in any number of existing posterior inference algorithms without modification. In this paper, we develop an efficient coreset construction algorithm for Bayesian logistic regression models. We provide theoretical guarantees on the size and approximation quality of the coreset -- both for fixed, known datasets, and in expectation for a wide class of data generative models. Crucially, the proposed approach also permits efficient construction of the coreset in both streaming and parallel settings, with minimal additional effort. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a number of synthetic and real-world datasets, and find that, in practice, the size of the coreset is independent of the original dataset size. Furthermore, constructing the coreset takes a negligible amount of time compared to that required to run MCMC on it.',\n",

However, other types of power laws that have been observed empirically and considered for applications such as clustering and feature allocation models have not been studied as frequently in models for graph data. In this paper, we enumerate desirable asymptotic behavior that may be of interest for modeling graph data, including sparsity and several types of power laws. We outline a general framework for graph generative models using completely random measures; by contrast to the pioneering work of Caron and Fox (2015), we consider instantiating more of the existing atoms of the random measure as the dataset size increases rather than adding new atoms to the measure. We see that these two models can be complementary; they respectively yield interpretations as (1) time passing among existing members of a network and (2) new individuals joining a network.

These two classes and their constituent representations subsume existing ones that have previously been developed in an ad hoc manner for specific processes. Since a complete infinite-dimensional CRM cannot be used explicitly for computation, sequential representations are often truncated for tractability. We provide truncation error analyses for each type of sequential representation, as well as their normalized versions, thereby generalizing and improving upon existing truncation error bounds in the literature. We analyze the computational complexity of the sequential representations, which in conjunction with our error bounds allows us to directly compare representations and discuss their relative efficiency.

The model provides a principled way to combine radio telemetry data with an arbitrary set of userdefined, spatial features. We describe an efficient stochastic gradient algorithm for fitting model parameters to data and demonstrate its effectiveness via asymptotic analysis and synthetic experiments. We also apply our model to real datasets, and show that it outperforms the most popular radio telemetry software package used in ecology. We conclude that integration of different data sources under a single statistical framework, coupled with appropriate parameter and state estimation procedures, produces both accurate location estimates and an interpretable statistical model of animal movement.',\n",
       " 'As the number of observed Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) continues to grow, follow-up resources need to be used more efficiently in order to maximize science output from limited telescope time. As such, it is becoming increasingly important to rapidly identify bursts of interest as soon as possible after the event, before the afterglows fade beyond detectability. Studying the most distant (highest redshift) events, for instance, remains a primary goal for many in the field. Here we present our Random forest Automated Triage Estimator for GRB redshifts (RATE GRB-z) for rapid identification of high-redshift candidates using early-time metrics from the three telescopes onboard Swift. While the basic RATE methodology is generalizable to a number of resource allocation problems, here we demonstrate its utility for telescope-constrained follow-up efforts with the primary goal to identify and study high-z GRBs. For each new GRB, RATE GRB-z provides a recommendation - based on the available telescope time - of whether the event warrants additional follow-up resources. We train RATE GRB-z using a set consisting of 135 Swift bursts with known redshifts, only 18 of which are z > 4. Cross-validated performance metrics on this training data suggest that ~56% of high-z bursts can be captured from following up the top 20% of the ranked candidates, and ~84% of high-z bursts are identified after following up the top ~40% of candidates. We further use the method to rank 200+ Swift bursts with unknown redshifts according to their likelihood of being high-z.',\n",

We introduce a combinatorial stochastic process known as the negative binomial process (NBP) as an infinite-dimensional prior appropriate for such problems. We show that the NBP is conjugate to the beta process, and we characterize the posterior distribution under the beta-negative binomial process (BNBP) and hierarchical models based on the BNBP (the HBNBP). We study the asymptotic properties of the BNBP and develop a three-parameter extension of the BNBP that exhibits power-law behavior.

A draw from the beta process yields an infinite collection of probabilities in the unit interval, and a draw from the Bernoulli process turns these into binary-valued features. Recent work has provided stick-breaking representations for the beta process analogous to the well-known stick-breaking representation for the Dirichlet process. We derive one such stick-breaking representation directly from the characterization of the beta process as a completely random measure. This approach motivates a three-parameter generalization of the beta process, and we study the power laws that can be obtained from this generalized beta process. We present a posterior inference algorithm for the beta-Bernoulli process that exploits the stick-breaking representation, and we present experimental results for a discrete factor-analysis model.',\n",

We present a single-switch selection method, \"Nomon,\" that is general and efficient. Existing single-switch selection methods require selectable options to be arranged in ways that limit potential applications. By contrast, traditional operating systems, web browsers, and free-form applications (such as drawing) place options at arbitrary points on the screen. Nomon, however, has the flexibility to select any point on a screen. Nomon adapts automatically to an individual\\'s clicking ability; it allows a person who clicks precisely to make a selection quickly and allows a person who clicks imprecisely more time to make a selection without error. Nomon reaps gains in information rate by allowing the specification of beliefs (priors) about option selection probabilities and by avoiding tree-based selection schemes in favor of direct (posterior) inference. We have developed both a Nomon-based writing application and a drawing application. To evaluate Nomon\\'s performance, we compared the writing application with a popular existing method for single-switch writing (row-column scanning). Novice users wrote 35% faster with the Nomon interface than with the scanning interface. An experienced user (author TB, with > 10 hours practice) wrote at speeds of 9.3 words per minute with Nomon, using 1.2 clicks per character and making no errors in the final text.',\n",
       " 'Recognizing the successes of treed Gaussian process (TGP) models as an interpretable and thrifty model for nonparametric regression, we seek to extend the model to classification. Both treed models and Gaussian processes (GPs) have, separately, enjoyed great success in application to classification problems. An example of the former is Bayesian CART. In the latter, real-valued GP output may be utilized for classification via latent variables, which provide classification rules by means of a softmax function. We formulate a Bayesian model averaging scheme to combine these two models and describe a Monte Carlo method for sampling from the full posterior distribution with joint proposals for the tree topology and the GP parameters corresponding to latent variables at the leaves. We concentrate on efficient sampling of the latent variables, which is important to obtain good mixing in the expanded parameter space. The tree structure is particularly helpful for this task and also for developing an efficient scheme for handling categorical predictors, which commonly arise in classification problems. Our proposed classification TGP (CTGP) methodology is illustrated on a collection of synthetic and real data sets. We assess performance relative to existing methods and thereby show how CTGP is highly flexible, offers tractable inference, produces rules that are easy to interpret, and performs well out of sample.',\n",

Finding these models requires us to solve an inverse problem: given experimentally measured expectation values, what are the parameters of the underlying Hamiltonian? This problem sits at the intersection of statistical physics and machine learning, and we suggest that more efficient solutions are possible by merging ideas from the two fields. We use a combination of recent coordinate descent algorithms with an adaptation of the histogram Monte Carlo method, and implement these techniques to take advantage of the sparseness found in data on real neurons. The resulting algorithm learns the parameters of an Ising model describing a network of forty neurons within a few minutes. This opens the possibility of analyzing much larger data sets now emerging, and thus testing hypotheses about the collective behaviors of these networks.',\n",
       " '  We present the results of attempts to detect the ellipticity of dark matter halos using galaxy-galaxy weak lensing with SDSS data. We use 2,020,256 galaxies brighter than r=19 with photometric redshifts (divided into colour and luminosity subsamples) as lenses and 31,697,869 source galaxies. We search for and identify several signal contaminants, which if not removed lead to a spurious detection. These include systematic shear that leads to a slight spurious alignment of lens and source ellipticities, intrinsic alignments (due to contamination of the source sample by physically-associated lens source pairs), and anisotropic magnification bias. We develop methods that allow us to remove these contaminants to the signal. We split the analysis into blue (spiral) and red (elliptical) galaxies. Assuming Gaussian errors as in previous work and a power-law profile, we find f_h=e_h/e_g=0.1+/-0.06 for red galaxies and -0.8+/-0.4 for blue galaxies using 20-300 kpc/h, averaged over luminosity. Inclusion of the more realistic non-Gaussian error distributions and of the NFW density profile (which predicts much smaller ellipticity of the shear for scales above the scale radius) yields 0.60+/-0.38 for ellipticals and -1.4+1.7-2.0 for spirals. While there is no concrete detection of alignment in either case, there is a suggestion in the data of a positive alignment in the brightest lens sample of ellipticals. Our results appear to be mildly inconsistent with a previously reported detection by Hoekstra et al. (2004), but more data and further tests are needed to clarify whether the discrepancy is real or a consequence of differences in the lens galaxy samples used and analysis methods.',\n",
       " '  We investigate the required redshift accuracy of type Ia supernova and cluster number-count surveys in order for the redshift uncertainties not to contribute appreciably to the dark energy parameter error budget. For the SNAP supernova experiment, we find that, without the assistance of ground-based measurements, individual supernova redshifts would need to be determined to about 0.002 or better, which is a challenging but feasible requirement for a low-resolution spectrograph. However, we find that accurate redshifts for z<0.1 supernovae, obtained with ground-based experiments, are sufficient to immunize the results against even relatively large redshift errors at high z. For the future cluster number-count surveys such as the South Pole Telescope, Planck or DUET, we find that the purely statistical error in photometric redshift is less important, and that the irreducible, systematic bias in redshift drives the requirements. The redshift bias will have to be kept below 0.001-0.005 per redshift bin (which is determined by the filter set), depending on the sky coverage and details of the definition of the minimal mass of the survey. Furthermore, we find that X-ray surveys have a more stringent required redshift accuracy than Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect surveys since they use a shorter lever arm in redshift; conversely, SZ surveys benefit from their high redshift reach only so long as some redshift information is available for distant (z>1) clusters.',\n",

However, observing these faint objects is a difficult task. As a consequence, important properties such as size and albedo are known for only a small fraction of them. Now, with the results from deep sky surveys and the Gaia space mission, a new exciting era is within reach as accurate predictions of stellar occultations by numerous distant small solar system bodies become available. From them, diameters with kilometer accuracies can be determined. Albedos, in turn, can be obtained from diameters and absolute magnitudes. We use observations from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) from November 2012 until February 2016, amounting to 4292847 CCD frames. We searched them for all known small solar system bodies and recovered a total of 202 TNOs and Centaurs, 63 of which have been discovered by the DES collaboration until the date of this writing. Their positions were determined using the Gaia Data Release 2 as reference and their orbits were refined. Stellar occultations were then predicted using these refined orbits plus stellar positions from Gaia. These predictions are maintained, and updated, in a dedicated web service. The techniques developed here are also part of an ambitious preparation to use the data from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), that expects to obtain accurate positions and multifilter photometry for tens of thousands of TNOs.',\n",

       " 'Energy carrier transport and recombination in emerging semiconductors can be directly monitored with optical microscopy, leading to the measurement of the diffusion coefficient (D), a critical property for the design of efficient optoelectronic devices. The diffusion coefficient is often determine by fitting a time-resolved expanding carrier profile after optical excitation using a Mean Squared Displacement Model. Although this approach has gained widespread adoption, there is no clear consensus as to which material systems, and under what experimental conditions (i.e. laser fluence), it can be applied. Here, we simulate diffusion processes in both excitonic and free carrier semiconductors and present a tailorable MSD Model that can accurately predict D for various materials. For perovskites, it is most accurate when sample D values are > 1 cm$^2$ s$^-$$^1$ and excitation densities are < 1x10$^1$$^6$ cm$^-$$^3$. At higher carrier densities, non-linear recombination terms can dominate the expansion of the carrier profile and lead to fitting error. We find that differences in grain size and boundary behavior, present in most thin films, can lead to distinct profiles that are not captured by MSD Models. Finally, we present clear strategies to investigate and control energy transport in disordered materials for more effective design and optimization of electronic and optoelectronic devices.',\n",

Tabletop generation of strong terahertz (THz) light fields has set the stage for dramatic advances in our ability to drive quantum materials into novel states that do not exist as equilibrium phases. However, THz-driven irreversible phase transitions are still unexplored. Large and doping-tunable energy barriers between multiple phases in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs) provide a testbed for THz polymorph engineering. Here we report experimental demonstration of an irreversible phase transition in 2D MoTe$_{2}$ from a semiconducting hexagonal phase (2H) to a predicted topological insulator distorted octahedral ($1T^{'}$) phase induced by field-enhanced terahertz pulses. This is achieved by THz field-induced carrier liberation and multiplication processes that result in a transient high carrier density that favors the $1T^{'}$ phase. Single-shot time-resolved second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements following THz excitation reveal that the transition out of the 2H phase occurs within 10 ns. This observation opens up new possibilities of THz-based phase patterning and has implications for ultrafast THz control over quantum phases in two-dimensional materials.\",\n",

The same optoelectronic properties that make perovskites ideal absorber materials in solar cells are also beneficial in other light-harvesting applications and make them prime candidates as triplet sensitizers in upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation in rubrene. In this contribution, we take advantage of long carrier lifetimes and carrier diffusion lengths in perovskite thin films, their high absorption cross sections throughout the visible spectrum, as well as the strong spin-orbit coupling owing to the abundance of heavy atoms to sensitize the upconverter rubrene. Employing bulk perovskite thin films as the absorber layer and spin-mixer in inorganic/organic heterojunction upconversion devices allows us to forego the additional tunneling barrier owing from the passivating ligands required for colloidal sensitizers. Our bilayer device exhibits an upconversion efficiency in excess of 3% under 785 nm illumination.',\n",

In metal halide perovskite solar cells, the achievable performance gains from photon recycling remain uncertain due to high variability in perovskite material quality and the non-radiative recombination rate ($k_{1}$). In this work, we study state-of-the-art $\\\\textrm{Cs}_{0.05}(\\\\textrm{MA}_{0.17}\\\\textrm{FA}_{0.83})_{0.95}\\\\textrm{Pb}(\\\\textrm{I}_{0.83}\\\\textrm{Br}_{0.17})_{3}$ films and analyze the impact of varying non-radiative recombination rates on photon recycling and device performance. Importantly, we predict the impact of photon recycling at the maximum power point (MPP), demonstrating an absolute PCE increase of up to 2.0% in the radiative limit, primarily due to a 77 mV increase in $V_{MPP}$. Even with finite non-radiative recombination, benefits from photon recycling can be achieved when non-radiative lifetimes and external LED electroluminescence efficiencies measured at open-circuit, $Q_{e}^{LED}(\\\\textrm{V}_{OC})$, exceed 2 $μ$s and 10%, respectively. This analysis clarifies the opportunity to fully exploit photon recycling to push the real-world performance of perovskite solar cells toward theoretical limits.',\n",
       " 'Halide perovskites are promising semiconductors for inexpensive, high-performance optoelectronics. Despite a remarkable defect tolerance compared to conventional semiconductors, perovskite thin films still show substantial microscale heterogeneity in key properties such as luminescence efficiency and device performance. This behavior has been attributed to spatial fluctuations in the population of sub-bandgap electronic states that act as trap-mediated non-radiative recombination sites. However, the origin of the variations, trap states and extent of the defect tolerance remains a topic of debate, and a precise understanding is critical to the rational design of defect management strategies. By combining scanning X-ray diffraction beamlines at two different synchrotrons with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, we reveal levels of heterogeneity on the ten-micrometer scale (super-grains) and even ten-nanometer scale (sub-grain domains). We find that local strain is associated with enhanced defect concentrations, and correlations between the local structure and time-resolved photoluminescence reveal that these strain-related defects are the cause of non-radiative recombination. We reveal a direct connection between defect concentrations and non-radiative losses, as well as complex heterogeneity across multiple length scales, shedding new light on the presence and influence of structural defects in halide perovskites.',\n",
       " 'Unique optical properties of colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), arising from quantum mechanical confinement of charge within these structures, present a versatile testbed for the study of how high electric fields affect the electronic structure of nanostructured solids. Earlier studies of quasi-DC electric field modulation of QD properties have been limited by the electrostatic breakdown processes under the high externally applied electric fields, which have restricted the range of modulation of QD properties. In contrast, in the present work we drive CdSe:CdS core:shell QD films with high-field THz-frequency electromagnetic pulses whose duration is only a few picoseconds. Surprisingly, in response to the THz excitation we observe QD luminescence even in the absence of an external charge source. Our experiments show that QD luminescence is associated with a remarkably high and rapid modulation of the QD band-gap, which is changing by more than 0.5 eV (corresponding to 25% of the unperturbed bandgap energy) within the picosecond timeframe of THz field profile. We show that these colossal energy shifts can be consistently explained by the quantum confined Stark effect. Our work demonstrates a route to extreme modulation of material properties without configurational changes in material sets or geometries. Additionally, we expect that this platform can be adapted to a novel compact THz detection scheme where conversion of THz fields (with meV-scale photon energies) to the visible/near-IR band (with eV-scale photon energies) can be achieved at room temperature with high bandwidth and sensitivity.',\n",

We consider plexcitons emerging from the interaction of excitons in an organic molecular layer with surface plasmons in a metallic film. We predict the emergence of Dirac cones in the two-dimensional bandstructure of plexcitons due to the inherent alignment of the excitonic transitions in the organic layer. These Dirac cones may open up in energy by simultaneously interfacing the metal with a magneto-optical layer and subjecting the whole system to a perpendicular magnetic field. The resulting energy gap becomes populated with topologically protected one-way modes which travel at the interface of this plexcitonic system. Our theoretical proposal suggests that plexcitons are a convenient and simple platform for the exploration of exotic phases of matter as well as of novel ways to direct energy flow at the nanoscale.',\n",
       " 'Many neural network pruning algorithms proceed in three steps: train the network to completion, remove unwanted structure to compress the network, and retrain the remaining structure to recover lost accuracy. The standard retraining technique, fine-tuning, trains the unpruned weights from their final trained values using a small fixed learning rate. In this paper, we compare fine-tuning to alternative retraining techniques. Weight rewinding (as proposed by Frankle et al., (2019)), rewinds unpruned weights to their values from earlier in training and retrains them from there using the original training schedule. Learning rate rewinding (which we propose) trains the unpruned weights from their final values using the same learning rate schedule as weight rewinding. Both rewinding techniques outperform fine-tuning, forming the basis of a network-agnostic pruning algorithm that matches the accuracy and compression ratios of several more network-specific state-of-the-art techniques.',\n",

       " 'Pruning is a well-established technique for removing unnecessary structure from neural networks after training to improve the performance of inference. Several recent results have explored the possibility of pruning at initialization time to provide similar benefits during training. In particular, the \"lottery ticket hypothesis\" conjectures that typical neural networks contain small subnetworks that can train to similar accuracy in a commensurate number of steps. The evidence for this claim is that a procedure based on iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) reliably finds such subnetworks retroactively on small vision tasks. However, IMP fails on deeper networks, and proposed methods to prune before training or train pruned networks encounter similar scaling limitations.\\n  In this paper, we argue that these efforts have struggled on deeper networks because they have focused on pruning precisely at initialization. We modify IMP to search for subnetworks that could have been obtained by pruning early in training (0.1% to 7% through) rather than at iteration 0. With this change, it finds small subnetworks of deeper networks (e.g., 80% sparsity on Resnet-50) that can complete the training process to match the accuracy of the original network on more challenging tasks (e.g., ImageNet). In situations where IMP fails at iteration 0, the accuracy benefits of delaying pruning accrue rapidly over the earliest iterations of training. To explain these behaviors, we study subnetwork \"stability,\" finding that - as accuracy improves in this fashion - IMP subnetworks train to parameters closer to those of the full network and do so with improved consistency in the face of gradient noise. These results offer new insights into the opportunity to prune large-scale networks early in training and the behaviors underlying the lottery ticket hypothesis.',\n",

       " \"In April 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration revealed the first image of the candidate super-massive black hole (SMBH) at the centre of the giant elliptical galaxy Messier 87 (M87). This event-horizon-scale image shows a ring of glowing plasma with a dark patch at the centre, which is interpreted as the shadow of the black hole. This breakthrough result, which represents a powerful confirmation of Einstein's theory of gravity, or general relativity, was made possible by assembling a global network of radio telescopes operating at millimetre wavelengths that for the first time included the Atacama Large Millimeter/ submillimeter Array (ALMA). The addition of ALMA as an anchor station has enabled a giant leap forward by increasing the sensitivity limits of the EHT by an order of magnitude, effectively turning it into an imaging array. The published image demonstrates that it is now possible to directly study the event horizon shadows of SMBHs via electromagnetic radiation, thereby transforming this elusive frontier from a mathematical concept into an astrophysical reality. The expansion of the array over the next few years will include new stations on different continents - and eventually satellites in space. This will provide progressively sharper and higher-fidelity images of SMBH candidates, and potentially even movies of the hot plasma orbiting around SMBHs. These improvements will shed light on the processes of black hole accretion and jet formation on event-horizon scales, thereby enabling more precise tests of general relativity in the truly strong field regime.\",\n",
       " 'The prosodic aspects of speech signals produced by current text-to-speech systems are typically averaged over training material, and as such lack the variety and liveliness found in natural speech. To avoid monotony and averaged prosody contours, it is desirable to have a way of modeling the variation in the prosodic aspects of speech, so audio signals can be synthesized in multiple ways for a given text. We present a new, hierarchically structured conditional variational autoencoder to generate prosodic features (fundamental frequency, energy and duration) suitable for use with a vocoder or a generative model like WaveNet. At inference time, an embedding representing the prosody of a sentence may be sampled from the variational layer to allow for prosodic variation. To efficiently capture the hierarchical nature of the linguistic input (words, syllables and phones), both the encoder and decoder parts of the auto-encoder are hierarchical, in line with the linguistic structure, with layers being clocked dynamically at the respective rates. We show in our experiments that our dynamic hierarchical network outperforms a non-hierarchical state-of-the-art baseline, and, additionally, that prosody transfer across sentences is possible by employing the prosody embedding of one sentence to generate the speech signal of another.',\n",

These short radio-wavelengths provide the best imaging resolution available from ground-based VLBI networks such as the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and the Global Millimeter VLBI Array (GMVA), but require specialized processing due to the strong effects from atmospheric opacity and turbulence as well as the heterogeneous nature of existing global arrays. The pipeline builds upon a calibration suite (HOPS) originally designed for precision geodetic VLBI. To support the reduction of data for astronomical observations, we have developed an additional framework for global phase and amplitude calibration which provides output in a standard data format for astronomical imaging and analysis. We test the pipeline on observations taken at 3.5 mm (86 GHz) by the GMVA joined by the phased Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in April 2017, and demonstrate the benefits from the specialized processing of high frequency VLBI data with respect to classical analysis techniques.',\n",

In such contexts, it is not uncommon to see sparse or even no overlap between some of the lists on which the estimates are based. These create difficulties in model fitting and selection, and we develop inference procedures to address these challenges. The approach is based on Poisson log-linear regression modeling. Issues investigated in detail include taking proper account of data sparsity in the estimation procedure, as well as the existence and identifiability of maximum likelihood estimates. A stepwise method for choosing the most suitable parameters is developed, together with a bootstrap approach to finding confidence intervals for the total population size. We apply the strategy to two empirical data sets of trafficking in US regions, and find that the approach results in stable, reasonable estimates.

       " 'Shot noise is an important ingredient to any measurement or theoretical modeling of discrete tracers of the large scale structure. Recent work has shown that the shot noise in the halo power spectrum becomes increasingly sub-Poissonian at high mass. Interestingly, while the halo model predicts a shot noise power spectrum in qualitative agreement with the data, it leads to an unphysical white noise in the cross halo-matter and matter power spectrum. In this work, we show that absorbing all the halo model sources of shot noise into the halo fluctuation field leads to meaningful predictions for the shot noise contributions to halo clustering statistics and remove the unphysical white noise from the cross halo-matter statistics. Our prescription straightforwardly maps onto the general bias expansion, so that the renormalized shot noise terms can be expressed as combinations of the halo model shot noises. Furthermore, we demonstrate that non-Poissonian contributions are related to volume integrals over correlation functions and their response to long-wavelength density perturbations. This leads to a new class of consistency relations for discrete tracers, which appear to be satisfied by our reformulation of the halo model. We test our theoretical predictions against measurements of halo shot noise bispectra extracted from a large suite of numerical simulations. Our model reproduces qualitatively the observed sub-Poissonian noise, although it underestimates the magnitude of this effect.',\n",
       " 'Regular medical records are useful for medical practitioners to analyze and monitor patient health status especially for those with chronic disease, but such records are usually incomplete due to unpunctuality and absence of patients. In order to resolve the missing data problem over time, tensor-based model is suggested for missing data imputation in recent papers because this approach makes use of low rank tensor assumption for highly correlated data. However, when the time intervals between records are long, the data correlation is not high along temporal direction and such assumption is not valid. To address this problem, we propose to decompose a matrix with missing data into its latent factors. Then, the locally linear constraint is imposed on these factors for matrix completion in this paper. By using a publicly available dataset and two medical datasets collected from hospital, experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the best performance by comparing with the existing methods.',\n",

Previous EHT observations have used visibility amplitudes to infer the morphology of the millimeter-wavelength emission. Potentially much richer source information is contained in the phases. We report on 1.3 mm phase information on Sgr A* obtained with the EHT on a total of 13 observing nights over 4 years. Closure phases, the sum of visibility phases along a closed triangle of interferometer baselines, are used because they are robust against phase corruptions introduced by instrumentation and the rapidly variable atmosphere. The median closure phase on a triangle including telescopes in California, Hawaii, and Arizona is nonzero. This result conclusively demonstrates that the millimeter emission is asymmetric on scales of a few Schwarzschild radii and can be used to break 180-degree rotational ambiguities inherent from amplitude data alone. The stability of the sign of the closure phase over most observing nights indicates persistent asymmetry in the image of Sgr A* that is not obscured by refraction due to interstellar electrons along the line of sight.',\n",
       " 'We study the halo-matter cross bispectrum in the presence of primordial non-Gaussianity of the local type. We restrict ourselves to the squeezed limit, for which the calculation are straightforward, and perform the measurements in the initial conditions of N-body simulations, to mitigate the contamination induced by nonlinear gravitational evolution. Interestingly, the halo-matter cross bispectrum is not trivial even in this simple limit as it is strongly sensitive to the scale-dependence of the quadratic and third-order halo bias. Therefore, it can be used to test biasing prescriptions. We consider three different prescription for halo clustering: excursion set peaks (ESP), local bias and a model in which the halo bias parameters are explicitly derived from a peak-background split. In all cases, the model parameters are fully constrained with statistics other than the cross bispectrum. We measure the cross bispectrum involving one halo fluctuation field and two mass overdensity fields for various halo masses and collapse redshifts. We find that the ESP is in reasonably good agreement with the numerical data, while the other alternatives we consider fail in various cases. This suggests that the scale-dependence of halo bias also is a crucial ingredient to the squeezed limit of the halo bispectrum.',\n",

We model the void auto-power spectrum taking into account the void biasing and exclusion effect. A good fit to the simulation data is obtained for voids with radii $\\\\gtrsim$ 30 Mpc/$h$, especially when the void biasing model is extended to 1-loop order. However, the best-fit bias parameters do not agree well with the peak-background split results.

       " 'We investigate nonlocal Lagrangian bias contributions involving gradients of the linear density field, for which we have predictions from the excursion set peak formalism. We begin by writing down a bias expansion which includes all the bias terms, including the nonlocal ones. Having checked that the model furnishes a reasonable fit to the halo mass function, we develop a 1-point cross-correlation technique to measure bias factors associated with 2-distributed quantities. We validate the method with numerical realizations of peaks of Gaussian random fields before we apply it to N-body simulations. We focus on the lowest (quadratic) order nonlocal contributions. We can reproduce our measurement of χ_{10} if we allow for an offset between the Lagrangian halo center-of-mass and the peak position. The sign and magnitude of χ_{10} is consistent with Lagrangian haloes sitting near linear density maxima. The resulting contribution to the halo bias can safely be ignored for M = 10^13 Msun/h, but could become relevant at larger halo masses. For the second nonlocal bias χ_{01} however, we measure a much larger magnitude than predicted by our model. We speculate that some of this discrepancy might originate from nonlocal Lagrangian contributions induced by nonspherical collapse.',\n",

Recent work has shown how to interpret such real space measurements in terms of k-dependent bias in Fourier space, and how to remove the k-dependence to reconstruct the k-independent peak-background split halo bias parameters. We compare our reconstruction of the linear bias, which requires no free parameters, with previous estimates from N-body simulations which were obtained directly in Fourier space at large scales, and find very good agreement. Our reconstruction of the quadratic bias is similarly parameter-free, although in this case there are no previous Fourier space measurements to compare with. Our analysis of N-body simulations explicitly tests the predictions of the excursion set peaks (ESP) formalism of Paranjape et al.

In the context of isolated neutron stars, we present the first study including self-consistently the magnetic damping of r-modes in the spin evolution. We track the spin evolution employing the RNS code, which accounts for the rotating structure of neutron stars for various equations of state. We find that, despite the strong damping due to the magnetic field, r-modes alter the braking rate from pure magnetic braking for B<10^{13}G. For realistic values of the saturation amplitude, the r-mode can also decrease the time to reach the threshold central density for quark deconfinement. Within a phenomenological model, we assess the gravitational waveform that would result from r-mode driven spindown of a magnetized neutron star. To contrast with the persistent signal during the spindown phase, we also present a preliminary estimate of the transient gravitational wave signal from an explosive quark-hadron phase transition, which can be a signal for the deconfinement of quarks inside neutron stars.',\n",

However, in practice, not only is $β$ chosen empirically without theoretical guidance, there is also a lack of theoretical understanding between $β$, learnability, the intrinsic nature of the dataset and model capacity. In this paper, we show that if $β$ is improperly chosen, learning cannot happen -- the trivial representation $P(Z|X)=P(Z)$ becomes the global minimum of the IB objective. We show how this can be avoided, by identifying a sharp phase transition between the unlearnable and the learnable which arises as $β$ is varied. This phase transition defines the concept of IB-Learnability. We prove several sufficient conditions for IB-Learnability, which provides theoretical guidance for choosing a good $β$. We further show that IB-learnability is determined by the largest confident, typical, and imbalanced subset of the examples (the conspicuous subset), and discuss its relation with model capacity.

From simulation capacity models, we estimate maximum tolerable error rate for meaningful simulation experiments on a near-term quantum computer.\\n  By exploiting symmetry inherent to the QSP circuit, we further demonstrate that its capacity for quantum simulation can be increased by at least two orders of magnitude if errors are systematic and unitary. We find that a device with $ε^2=10^{-5}$ systematic amplitude errors could meaningfully simulate systems up to $n\\\\approx16$ with an expected failure rate below $10\\\\%$, whereas the largest system a device with a stochastic error rate of $p_ε=10^{-5}$ could meaningfully simulate with the same rate of failure is between $n=3$ and $n=5$ (depending on the stochastic channel). Extrapolating from empirical results, we estimate that one would typically need a stochastic error rate below $p_ε=10^{-8}$ to perform a meaningful $n=50$ simulation experiment with a failure rate below $10\\\\%$, while the same experiment could tolerate systematic unitary errors with strength $ε^2\\\\approx10^{-6}$.',\n",
       " \"To understand the fundamental trade-offs between training stability, temporal dynamics and architectural complexity of recurrent neural networks~(RNNs), we directly analyze RNN architectures using numerical methods of ordinary differential equations~(ODEs). We define a general family of RNNs--the ODERNNs--by relating the composition rules of RNNs to integration methods of ODEs at discrete time steps. We show that the degree of RNN's functional nonlinearity $n$ and the range of its temporal memory $t$ can be mapped to the corresponding stage of Runge-Kutta recursion and the order of time-derivative of the ODEs. We prove that popular RNN architectures, such as LSTM and URNN, fit into different orders of $n$-$t$-ODERNNs. This exact correspondence between RNN and ODE helps us to establish the sufficient conditions for RNN training stability and facilitates more flexible top-down designs of new RNN architectures using large varieties of toolboxes from numerical integration of ODEs. We provide such an example: Quantum-inspired Universal computing Neural Network~(QUNN), which reduces the required number of training parameters from polynomial in both data length and temporal memory length to only linear in temporal memory length.\",\n",

The optimization formulation incorporates pulse sequence length and cardinality penalties consistent with linear or integer programming. We apply the general technique to magnetometry with solid state spin ensembles in which inhomogeneous interactions between sensing spins limit coherence. Defining figures of merit for broadband Ramsey magnetometry, we present novel pulse sequences which outperform known techniques for homonuclear spin decoupling in both spin-1/2 and spin-1 systems. When applied to nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, this scheme partially preserves the Zeeman interaction while zeroing dipolar coupling between negatively charged NV$^{\\\\text -}$ centers. Such a scheme is of interest for NV$^\\\\text{-}$ magnetometers which have reached the NV$^\\\\text{-}$-NV$^\\\\text{-}$ coupling limit.

The model code is then employed by a meta-generative model to construct parameters for the task-specific model. We demonstrate that for previously unseen tasks, without additional training, this Meta-Learning Autoencoder (MeLA) framework can build models that closely match the true underlying models, with loss significantly lower than given by fine-tuned baseline networks, and performance that compares favorably with state-of-the-art meta-learning algorithms.

Our symmetry-operator framework provides a systematic procedure for finding QEC codes that are not stabilizer codes. The $χ^{(2)}$ binomial code is of special interest because, with $m\\\\le N$ identified from channel monitoring, it can correct $m$-photon loss errors, $m$-photon gain errors, and $(m-1)$th-order dephasing errors using logical qudits that are encoded in $O(N)$ photons. In comparison, other bosonic QEC codes require $O(N^2)$ photons to correct the same degree of bosonic errors. Such improved photon-efficiency underscores the additional error-correction power that can be provided by channel monitoring. We develop quantum Hamming bounds for photon-loss errors in the code subspaces associated with the $χ^{(2)}$ parity-check code and the $χ^{(2)}$ embedded error-correcting code, and we prove that these codes saturate their respective bounds. Our $χ^{(2)}$ QEC codes exhibit hardware efficiency in that they address the principal error mechanisms and exploit the available physical interactions of the underlying hardware, thus reducing the physical resources required for implementing their encoding, decoding, and error-correction operations, and their universal encoded-basis gate sets.',\n",

Here, we calculate error rates and resource overheads for implementing logical CCZ with pieceable fault-tolerance, a non-transversal method for implementing logical gates. We provide a comparison with a non-local magic-state scheme on a concatenated code and a local magic-state scheme on the surface code. We find the pieceable fault-tolerance scheme particularly advantaged over magic states on concatenated codes and in certain regimes over magic states on the surface code. Our results suggest that pieceable fault-tolerance is a promising candidate for fault-tolerance in a near-future quantum computer.',\n",

While the famous Grover's algorithm can search quadratically faster than a classical computer, it lacks the fixed-point property --- the fraction of target items must be known precisely to know when to terminate the algorithm. Recently, Yoder, Low, and Chuang gave an optimal gate-model search algorithm with the fixed-point property. Meanwhile, it is known that an adiabatic quantum algorithm, operating by continuously varying a Hamiltonian, can reproduce the quadratic speedup of gate-model Grover search. We ask, can an adiabatic algorithm also reproduce the fixed-point property? We show that the answer depends on what interpolation schedule is used, so as in the gate model, there are both fixed-point and non-fixed-point versions of adiabatic search, only some of which attain the quadratic quantum speedup. Guided by geometric intuition on the Bloch sphere, we rigorously justify our claims with an explicit upper bound on the error in the adiabatic approximation. We also show that the fixed-point adiabatic search algorithm can be simulated in the gate model with neither loss of the quadratic Grover speedup nor of the fixed-point property. Finally, we discuss natural uses of fixed-point algorithms such as preparation of a relatively prime state and oblivious amplitude amplification.\",\n",

Here we demonstrate precisely the existence of such gates. In particular, we show how the limits of non-transversality can be overcome by performing rounds of intermediate error-correction to create logical gates on stabilizer codes that use no ancillas other than those required for syndrome measurement. Moreover, the logical gates we construct, the most prominent examples being Toffoli and controlled-controlled-Z, often complete universal gate sets on their codes.

One remarkable result of this generalization is that any nondegenerate stabilizer code with a complete set of fault-tolerant single-qubit Clifford gates has a universal set of fault-tolerant gates.

Starting from a tensor product state which is the exact ground state of a Hamiltonian with $\\\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order, we show that, surprisingly, not all variations of the tensors correspond to the variation of the ground state caused by local perturbations of the Hamiltonian.

However, the precise set of gates in $\\\\mathcal{C}_k$ remains unknown, even for a fixed number of qubits $n$, which prevents us from knowing exactly what teleportation is capable of. In this paper we study the structure of $\\\\mathcal{C}_k$ in terms of semi-Clifford operations, which send by conjugation at least one maximal abelian subgroup of the $n$-qubit Pauli group into another one. We show that for $n=1,2$, all the $\\\\mathcal{C}_k$ gates are semi-Clifford, which is also true for $\\\\{n=3,k=3\\\\}$. However, this is no longer true for $\\\\{n>2,k>3\\\\}$. To measure the capability of this teleportation primitive, we introduce a quantity called `teleportation depth', which characterizes how many teleportation steps are necessary, on average, to implement a given gate.

Furthermore, the use of liquid crystal solvents offers scalability in the form of an expanded library of spin-bearing molecules suitable for NMRQC. These ideas are demonstrated with the successful execution of a 2-qubit Grover search using a molecule ($^{13}$C$^{1}$HCl$_3$) oriented in a liquid crystal and a clock speed eight times greater than in an isotropic solvent.

A property of such markets that has been given limited consideration thus far is the externality faced by a firm when data is allocated to other, competing firms. Addressing this is likely necessary for progress towards the practical implementation of such markets. In this work, we consider the case with $n$ competing firms and a monopolistic data seller. We demonstrate that modeling the utility of firms solely through the increase in prediction accuracy experienced reduces the complex, combinatorial problem of allocating and pricing multiple data sets to an auction of a single digital (freely replicable) good. Crucially, this is what enables us to model the negative externalities experienced by a firm resulting from other firms' allocations. We obtain forms of the welfare-maximizing and revenue-maximizing auctions for such settings. We highlight how the form of the firms' private information -- whether they know the externalities they exert on others or that others exert on them -- affects the structure of the optimal mechanisms. We find that in all cases, the optimal allocation rules turn out to be single thresholds (one per firm), in which the seller allocates all information or none of it to a firm.

A key challenge for large-scale plug and play deployment of the smart building technology is the ability to learn a good control policy in a short period of time, i.e. having a low sample complexity for the learning control agent. Motivated by this problem and to remedy the issue of high sample complexity in the general context of cyber-physical systems, we propose an event-triggered paradigm for learning and control with variable-time intervals, as opposed to the traditional constant-time sampling. The events occur when the system state crosses the a priori-parameterized switching manifolds; this crossing triggers the learning as well as the control processes. Policy gradient and temporal difference methods are employed to learn the optimal switching manifolds which define the optimal control policy. We propose two event-triggered learning algorithms for stochastic and deterministic control policies. We show the efficacy of our proposed approach via designing a smart learning thermostat for autonomous micro-climate control in buildings.

The latter are precisely the instances where properties of interest are not preserved or behave very badly when systems interact. The goal is to overcome that obstruction. We will show how to extract mathematical objects from the systems, that encode their generativity: their potential to generate new phenomena upon interaction.

Second, the notion of interconnection and variable sharing is shown to be a construction of the same nature as that of gluing topological spaces or taking amalgamated sums of algebraic objects. Third, the notion of interconnection instantiates to both the syntax space and the semantics space, and the interpretation map is shown to preserve the interconnection when going from syntax to semantics.

The second measure is concerned with the notion of \"tail risk\" which arises in economic and financial networks. We study the question of why such performance measures may deteriorate at a faster rate than the growth rate of the network. We first focus on the energy metric and its well known connection to controllability Gramian of the underlying dynamical system. We show that undirected networks exhibit the most graceful energy growth rates as network size grows. This rate is quantified completely by the proximity of spectral radius to unity or distance to instability. In contrast, we show that the simple characterization of energy in terms of network spectrum does not exist for directed networks. We demonstrate that, for any fixed distance to instability, energy of a directed network can grow at an exponentially faster rate. We provide general methods for manipulating networks to reduce energy. In particular, we prove that certain operations that increase the symmetry in a network cannot increase energy (in an order sense). Secondly, we focus on tail risk in economic and financial networks. In contrast to $\\\\Hcal_2$--norm which arises from computing the expectation of energy in the network, tail risk focuses on tail probability behavior of network variables. Although the two measures differ substantially we show that they are precisely connected through the system Gramian.

When all players are truth-telling, the problem of opinion consensus is decoupled from the coalitional game, but interesting dynamics will arise when players are strategic in the consensus phase. Assuming that all players are rational, the model implies that, if influential players are risk-averse, an efficient fusion of the distributed data is achieved at pure strategy Nash equilibrium, meaning that the average opinion will not drift. Also, without the assumption that all players are rational, each player can use an algorithmic R-learning process, which gives the same result as the pure strategy Nash equilibrium with rational players.',\n",

To contribute to the analysis of consumer behavior in response to such incentives, this paper formulates Demand Response as a Mechanism Design problem, where a Demand Response Provider elicits private information of its rational, profit-maximizing customers who derive positive expected utility by participating in reduction events.

In such systems, some external inflow is injected to the so-called origin nodes of the network. The total inflow arriving at each node is routed to its operational outgoing links based on their current particle densities. The density on each link has first order dynamics driven by the difference of its incoming and outgoing flows. A link irreversibly fails if it reaches its jam density. Such failures may propagate in the network and cause a systemic failure. We show that larger link capacities do not necessarily help in preventing systemic failures under local routing. Accordingly, we propose the use of variable speed limits to operate the links below their capacities, when necessary, to compensate for the lack of global information and coordination in routing decisions. Our main result shows that systemic failures under feasible external inflows can always be averted through a proper selection of speed limits if the routing decisions are sufficiently responsive to local congestion and the network is initially uncongested.

Under mild assumptions on the generation cost of electricity and consumers' backlog disutility functions, we show that, for consumer models with price memory only, market stability is achieved if the ratio between the consumers' marginal backlog disutility and the suppliers' marginal cost of supply remains below a fixed threshold.

In this setting, an external inflow is injected to the so-called origin nodes. The total inflow arriving at each node is routed locally such that none of the outgoing links are overloaded unless the node receives an inflow greater than its total outgoing capacity. A link irreversibly fails if it is overloaded or if there is no operational link in its immediate downstream to carry its flow. For such systems, resilience is defined as the minimum amount of reduction in the link capacities that would result in the failure of all the outgoing links of an origin node. We show that such networks do not necessarily become more resilient as additional capacity is built in the network. Moreover, when the external inflow does not exceed the network capacity, selective reductions of capacity at certain links can actually help averting the cascading failures, without requiring any change in the local routing policies. This is an attractive feature as it is often easier in practice to reduce the available capacity of some critical links than to add physical capacity or to alter routing policies, e.g., when such policies are determined by social behavior, as in the case of road traffic networks.

We develop a notion of mu-rank to capture the energy of a system, and understand the minimal amount of effort required to fail a system, termed resilience. We deduce a dual notion of fragility and show that the combination of systems sets a limit on the amount of fragility inherited.',\n",

Given the joint probabilities of finite length strings of the process, we are interested in finding a finite state generative model to describe the entire process. In particular, we focus on two classes of models: HMMs and quasi-HMMs, which is a strictly larger class of models containing HMMs. In the main theorem, we show that if the random process is generated by an HMM of order less or equal than k, and whose transition and observation probability matrix are in general position, namely almost everywhere on the parameter space, both the minimal quasi-HMM realization and the minimal HMM realization can be efficiently computed based on the joint probabilities of all the length N strings, for N > 4 lceil log_d(k) rceil +1. In this paper, we also aim to compare and connect the two lines of literature: realization theory of HMMs, and the recent development in learning latent variable models with tensor decomposition techniques.',\n",
       " 'We propose a dynamical model for cascading failures in single-commodity network flows. In the proposed model, the network state consists of flows and activation status of the links. Network dynamics is determined by a, possibly state-dependent and adversarial, disturbance process that reduces flow capacity on the links, and routing policies at the nodes that have access to the network state, but are oblivious to the presence of disturbance. Under the proposed dynamics, a link becomes irreversibly inactive either due to overload condition on itself or on all of its immediate downstream links. The coupling between link activation and flow dynamics implies that links to become inactive successively are not necessarily adjacent to each other, and hence the pattern of cascading failure under our model is qualitatively different than standard cascade models. The magnitude of a disturbance process is defined as the sum of cumulative capacity reductions across time and links of the network, and the margin of resilience of the network is defined as the infimum over the magnitude of all disturbance processes under which the links at the origin node become inactive. We propose an algorithm to compute an upper bound on the margin of resilience for the setting where the routing policy only has access to information about the local state of the network. For the limiting case when the routing policies update their action as fast as network dynamics, we identify sufficient conditions on network parameters under which the upper bound is tight under an appropriate routing policy. Our analysis relies on making connections between network parameters and monotonicity in network state evolution under proposed dynamics.',\n",
       " 'The primary concerns of this paper are twofold: to understand the economic value of storage in the presence of ramp constraints and exogenous electricity prices, and to understand the implications of the associated optimal storage management policy on qualitative and quantitative characteristics of storage response to real-time prices. We present an analytic characterization of the optimal policy, along with the associated finite-horizon time-averaged value of storage. We also derive an analytical upperbound on the infinite-horizon time-averaged value of storage. This bound is valid for any achievable realization of prices when the support of the distribution is fixed, and highlights the dependence of the value of storage on ramp constraints and storage capacity. While the value of storage is a non-decreasing function of price volatility, due to the finite ramp rate, the value of storage saturates quickly as the capacity increases, regardless of volatility. To study the implications of the optimal policy, we first present computational experiments that suggest that optimal utilization of storage can, in expectation, induce a considerable amount of price elasticity near the average price, but little or no elasticity far from it. We then present a computational framework for understanding the behavior of storage as a function of price and the amount of stored energy, and for characterization of the buy/sell phase transition region in the price-state plane. Finally, we study the impact of market-based operation of storage on the required reserves, and show that the reserves may need to be expanded to accommodate market-based storage.',\n",
       " \"We study a model for cascade effects over finite networks based on a deterministic binary linear threshold model. Our starting point is a networked coordination game where each agent's payoff is the sum of the payoffs coming from pairwise interactions with each of the neighbors. We first establish that the best response dynamics in this networked game is equivalent to the linear threshold dynamics with heterogeneous thresholds over the agents. While the previous literature has studied such linear threshold models under the assumption that each agent may change actions at most once, a study of best response dynamics in such networked games necessitates an analysis that allows for multiple switches in actions. In this paper, we develop such an analysis and construct a combinatorial framework to understand the behavior of the model. To this end, we establish that the agents behavior cycles among different actions in the limit and provide three sets of results.\\n  We first characterize the limiting behavioral properties of the dynamics. We determine the length of the limit cycles and reveal bounds on the time steps required to reach such cycles for different network structures. We then study the complexity of decision/counting problems that arise within the context. Specifically, we consider the tractability of counting the number of limit cycles and fixed-points, and deciding the reachability of action profiles. We finally propose a measure of network resilience that captures the nature of the involved dynamics. We prove bounds and investigate the resilience of different network structures under this measure.\",\n",
       " 'In this paper, we examine in an abstract framework, how a tradeoff between efficiency and robustness arises in different dynamic oligopolistic market architectures. We consider a market in which there is a monopolistic resource provider and agents that enter and exit the market following a random process. Self-interested and fully rational agents dynamically update their resource consumption decisions over a finite time horizon, under the constraint that the total resource consumption requirements are met before each individual\\'s deadline. We then compare the statistics of the stationary aggregate demand processes induced by the non-cooperative and cooperative load scheduling schemes. We show that although the non-cooperative load scheduling scheme leads to an efficiency loss - widely known as the \"price of anarchy\" - the stationary distribution of the corresponding aggregate demand process has a smaller tail. This tail, which corresponds to rare and undesirable demand spikes, is important in many applications of interest. On the other hand, when the agents can cooperate with each other in optimizing their total cost, a higher market efficiency is achieved at the cost of a higher probability of demand spikes. We thus posit that the origins of endogenous risk in such systems may lie in the market architecture, which is an inherent characteristic of the system.',\n",
       " 'Robustness of routing policies for networks is a central problem which is gaining increased attention with a growing awareness to safeguard critical infrastructure networks against natural and man-induced disruptions. Routing under limited information and the possibility of cascades through the network adds serious challenges to this problem. This abstract considers the framework of dynamical networks introduced in our earlier work [1,2], where the network is modeled by a system of ordinary differential equations derived from mass conservation laws on directed acyclic graphs with a single origin-destination pair and a constant inflow at the origin. The rate of change of the particle density on each link of the network equals the difference between the inflow and the outflow on that link. The latter is modeled to depend on the current particle density on that link through a flow function. The novel modeling element in this paper is that every link is assumed to have finite capacity for particle density and that the flow function is modeled to be strictly increasing as density increases from zero up to the maximum density capacity, and is discontinuous at the maximum density capacity, with the flow function value being zero at that point. This feature, in particular, allows for the possibility of spill-backs in our model. In this paper, we present our results on resilience of such networks under distributed routing, towards perturbations that reduce link-wise flow functions.',\n",
       " \"This paper examines the value of storage in securing reliability of a system with uncertain supply and demand, and supply friction. The storage is frictionless as a supply source, but once used, it cannot be filled up instantaneously. The focus application is a power supply network in which the base supply and demand are assumed to match perfectly, while deviations from the base are modeled as random shocks with stochastic arrivals. Due to friction, the random surge shocks cannot be tracked by the main supply sources. Storage, when available, can be used to compensate, fully or partially, for the surge in demand or loss of supply. The problem of optimal utilization of storage with the objective of maximizing system reliability is formulated as minimization of the expected discounted cost of blackouts over an infinite horizon. It is shown that when the stage cost is linear in the size of the blackout, the optimal policy is myopic in the sense that all shocks are compensated by storage up to the available level of storage. However, when the stage cost is strictly convex, it may be optimal to curtail some of the demand and allow a small current blackout in the interest of maintaining a higher level of reserve to avoid a large blackout in the future. The value of storage capacity in improving system's reliability, as well as the effects of the associated optimal policies under different stage costs on the probability distribution of blackouts are examined.\",\n",

Our approach allows one to easily establish consistent estimators for a very large class of canonical estimation problems, in a large alphabet setting. These include the problems studied in the original paper, such as entropy and probability estimation, in addition to many other interesting ones. We particularly illustrate this approach by consistently estimating the size of the alphabet and the range of the probabilities. We start by proposing an abstract methodology based on constructing a probability measure with the desired asymptotic properties. We then demonstrate two concrete constructions by casting the Good-Turing estimator as a pseudo-empirical measure, and by using the theory of mixture model estimation.\",\n",
       " \"The paper proposes a framework for modeling and analysis of the dynamics of supply, demand, and clearing prices in power system with real-time retail pricing and information asymmetry. Real-time retail pricing is characterized by passing on the real-time wholesale electricity prices to the end consumers, and is shown to create a closed-loop feedback system between the physical layer and the market layer of the power system. In the absence of a carefully designed control law, such direct feedback between the two layers could increase volatility and lower the system's robustness to uncertainty in demand and generation. A new notion of generalized price-elasticity is introduced, and it is shown that price volatility can be characterized in terms of the system's maximal relative price elasticity, defined as the maximal ratio of the generalized price-elasticity of consumers to that of the producers. As this ratio increases, the system becomes more volatile, and eventually, unstable. As new demand response technologies and distributed storage increase the price-elasticity of demand, the architecture under examination is likely to lead to increased volatility and possibly instability. This highlights the need for assessing architecture systematically and in advance, in order to optimally strike the trade-offs between volatility, economic efficiency, and system reliability.\",\n",
       " 'Strong resilience properties of dynamical flow networks are analyzed for distributed routing policies. The latter are characterized by the property that the way the inflow at a non-destination node gets split among its outgoing links is allowed to depend only on local information about the current particle densities on the outgoing links. The strong resilience of the network is defined as the infimum sum of link-wise flow capacity reductions under which the network cannot maintain the asymptotic total inflow to the destination node to be equal to the inflow at the origin. A class of distributed routing policies that are locally responsive to local information is shown to yield the maximum possible strong resilience under such local information constraints for an acyclic dynamical flow network with a single origin-destination pair. The maximal strong resilience achievable is shown to be equal to the minimum node residual capacity of the network. The latter depends on the limit flow of the unperturbed network and is defined as the minimum, among all the non-destination nodes, of the sum, over all the links outgoing from the node, of the differences between the maximum flow capacity and the limit flow of the unperturbed network. We propose a simple convex optimization problem to solve for equilibrium limit flows of the unperturbed network that minimize average delay subject to strong resilience guarantees, and discuss the use of tolls to induce such an equilibrium limit flow in transportation networks. Finally, we present illustrative simulations to discuss the connection between cascaded failures and the resilience properties of the network.',\n",
       " \"Robustness of distributed routing policies is studied for dynamical flow networks, with respect to adversarial disturbances that reduce the link flow capacities. A dynamical flow network is modeled as a system of ordinary differential equations derived from mass conservation laws on a directed acyclic graph with a single origin-destination pair and a constant inflow at the origin. Routing policies regulate the way the inflow at a non-destination node gets split among its outgoing links as a function of the current particle density, while the outflow of a link is modeled to depend on the current particle density on that link through a flow function. The dynamical flow network is called partially transferring if the total inflow at the destination node is asymptotically bounded away from zero, and its weak resilience is measured as the minimum sum of the link-wise magnitude of all disturbances that make it not partially transferring. The weak resilience of a dynamical flow network with arbitrary routing policy is shown to be upper-bounded by the network's min-cut capacity, independently of the initial flow conditions. Moreover, a class of distributed routing policies that rely exclusively on local information on the particle densities, and are locally responsive to that, is shown to yield such maximal weak resilience. These results imply that locality constraints on the information available to the routing policies do not cause loss of weak resilience. Some fundamental properties of dynamical flow networks driven by locally responsive distributed policies are analyzed in detail, including global convergence to a unique limit flow.\",\n",
       " \"Stability of Wardrop equilibria is analyzed for dynamical transportation networks in which the drivers' route choices are influenced by information at multiple temporal and spatial scales. The considered model involves a continuum of indistinguishable drivers commuting between a common origin/destination pair in an acyclic transportation network. The drivers' route choices are affected by their, relatively infrequent, perturbed best responses to global information about the current network congestion levels, as well as their instantaneous local observation of the immediate surroundings as they transit through the network. A novel model is proposed for the drivers' route choice behavior, exhibiting local consistency with their preference toward globally less congested paths as well as myopic decisions in favor of locally less congested paths. The simultaneous evolution of the traffic congestion on the network and of the aggregate path preference is modeled by a system of coupled ordinary differential equations. The main result shows that, if the frequency of updates of path preferences is sufficiently small as compared to the frequency of the traffic flow dynamics, then the state of the transportation network ultimately approaches a neighborhood of the Wardrop equilibrium. The presented results may be read as a further evidence in support of Wardrop's postulate of equilibrium, showing robustness of it with respect to non-persistent perturbations. The proposed analysis combines techniques from singular perturbation theory, evolutionary game theory, and cooperative dynamical systems.\",\n",

Aerial capabilities and relatively low costs make drones the perfect solution to improve the efficiency of those operations that are typically carried out by humans (e.g., building inspection, photo collection). The potential of drone applications can be pushed even further when they are operated in fleets and in a fully autonomous manner, acting de facto as a drone swarm. Besides automating field operations, a drone swarm can serve as an ad-hoc cloud infrastructure built on top of computing and storage resources available across the swarm members and other connected elements. Even in the absence of Internet connectivity, this cloud can serve the workloads generated by the swarm members themselves, as well as by the field agents operating within the area of interest. By considering the practical example of a swarm-powered 3D reconstruction application, we present a new optimization problem for the efficient generation and execution, on top of swarm-powered ad-hoc cloud infrastructure, of multi-node computing workloads subject to data geolocation and clustering constraints. The objective is the minimization of the overall computing times, including both networking delays caused by the inter-drone data transmission and computation delays.

The main goal of this work is to test the capabilities of the Atacama Compact Array (ACA; also known as the Morita Array) Band 3 observations, centered at about 97.5 GHz, to provide robust validation of cluster detections via the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect. Using a pilot sample that comprises ten MaDCoWS galaxy clusters, accessible to ACA and representative of the median sample richness, we infer the masses of the selected galaxy clusters and respective detection significance by means of a Bayesian analysis of the interferometric data. Our test of the \"Verification with the ACA - Localization and Cluster Analysis\" (VACA LoCA) program demonstrates that the ACA can robustly confirm the presence of the virialized intracluster medium in galaxy clusters previously identified in full-sky surveys. In particular, we obtain a significant detection of the SZ effect for seven out of the ten VACA LoCA clusters. We note that this result is independent of the assumed pressure profile. However, the limited angular dynamic range of the ACA in Band 3 alone, short observational integration times, and possible contamination from unresolved sources limit the detailed characterization of the cluster properties and the inference of the cluster masses within scales appropriate for the robust calibration of mass-richness scaling relations.',\n",

       " \"Objective: Global Maxwell Tomography (GMT) is a recently introduced volumetric technique for noninvasive estimation of electrical properties (EP) from magnetic resonance measurements. Previous work evaluated GMT using ideal radiofrequency (RF) excitations. The aim of this simulation study was to assess GMT performance with a realistic RF coil. Methods: We designed a transmit-receive RF coil with $8$ decoupled channels for $7$T head imaging. We calculated the RF transmit field ($B_1^+$) inside heterogeneous head models for different RF shimming approaches, and used them as input for GMT to reconstruct EP for all voxels. Results: Coil tuning/decoupling remained relatively stable when the coil was loaded with different head models. Mean error in EP estimation changed from $7.5\\\\%$ to $9.5\\\\%$ and from $4.8\\\\%$ to $7.2\\\\%$ for relative permittivity and conductivity, respectively, when changing head model without re-tuning the coil. Results slightly improved when an SVD-based RF shimming algorithm was applied, in place of excitation with one coil at a time. Despite errors in EP, RF transmit field ($B_1^+$) and absorbed power could be predicted with less than $0.5\\\\%$ error over the entire head. GMT could accurately detect a numerically inserted tumor. Conclusion: This work demonstrates that GMT can reliably reconstruct EP in realistic simulated scenarios using a tailored 8-channel RF coil design at $7$T. Future work will focus on construction of the coil and optimization of GMT's robustness to noise, to enable in-vivo GMT experiments. Significance: GMT could provide accurate estimations of tissue EP, which could be used as biomarkers and could enable patient-specific estimation of RF power deposition, which is an unsolved problem for ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging.\",\n",

While immense interests were in either crafting adversarial attacks as a way to measure the robustness of neural networks or devising worst-case analytical robustness verification with guarantees, few methods could enjoy both scalability and robustness guarantees at the same time. As an alternative to these attempts, randomized smoothing adopts a different prediction rule that enables statistical robustness arguments and can scale to large networks. However, in this paper, we point out for the first time the side effects of current randomized smoothing workflows.

This instability leads to deconfined phases in lattice gauge theories without the need of plaquette interactions, identifying a promising route for future quantum-simulation experiments.

While current verification methods mainly focus on the L_p-norm-ball threat model of the input instances, robustness verification against semantic adversarial attacks inducing large L_p-norm perturbations such as color shifting and lighting adjustment are beyond their capacity. To bridge this gap, we propose Semantify-NN, a model-agnostic and generic robustness verification approach against semantic perturbations for neural networks. By simply inserting our proposed semantic perturbation layers (SP-layers) to the input layer of any given model, Semantify-NN is model-agnostic, and any $L_p$-norm-ball based verification tools can be used to verify the model robustness against semantic perturbations. We illustrate the principles of designing the SP-layers and provide examples including semantic perturbations to image classification in the space of hue, saturation, lightness, brightness, contrast and rotation, respectively. Experimental results on various network architectures and different datasets demonstrate the superior verification performance of Semantify-NN over L_p-norm-based verification frameworks that naively convert semantic perturbation to L_p-norm. To the best of our knowledge, Semantify-NN is the first framework to support robustness verification against a wide range of semantic perturbations.',\n",

In order to achieve this, the proposed Active Multi-Output Gaussian Process Emulator (AMOGAPE) combines the predictive capacity of Gaussian Processes (GPs) with the design of an acquisition function that favors sampling in low density and fluctuating regions of the approximation functions. Comparing different acquisition functions, we illustrate the promising performance of the method for the construction of emulators with toy examples, as well as for a widely used remote sensing transfer code.',\n",
       " 'The rapid growth of deep learning applications in real life is accompanied by severe safety concerns. To mitigate this uneasy phenomenon, much research has been done providing reliable evaluations of the fragility level in different deep neural networks. Apart from devising adversarial attacks, quantifiers that certify safeguarded regions have also been designed in the past five years. The summarizing work of Salman et al. unifies a family of existing verifiers under a convex relaxation framework. We draw inspiration from such work and further demonstrate the optimality of deterministic CROWN (Zhang et al. 2018) solutions in a given linear programming problem under mild constraints. Given this theoretical result, the computationally expensive linear programming based method is shown to be unnecessary. We then propose an optimization-based approach \\\\textit{FROWN} (\\\\textbf{F}astened C\\\\textbf{ROWN}): a general algorithm to tighten robustness certificates for neural networks. Extensive experiments on various networks trained individually verify the effectiveness of FROWN in safeguarding larger robust regions.',\n",
       " 'Photoinduced isomerization reactions, including ring-opening reactions, lie at the heart of many processes in nature. The mechanisms of such reactions are determined by a delicate interplay of coupled electronic and nuclear dynamics unfolding on the femtosecond scale, followed by the slower redistribution of energy into different vibrational degrees of freedom. Here we apply time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy with a seeded extreme ultraviolet free electron laser to trace the ultrafast ring opening of gas phase thiophenone molecules following photoexcitation at 265 nm. When combined with cutting edge ab initio electronic structure and molecular dynamics calculations of both the excited and ground state molecules, the results provide unprecedented insights into both electronic and nuclear dynamics of this fundamental class of reactions. The initial ring opening and non-adiabatic coupling to the electronic ground state is shown to be driven by ballistic SC bond extension and to be complete within 350 femtoseconds. Theory and experiment also allow clear visualization of the rich ground-state dynamics involving formation of, and interconversion between, several ring opened isomers and the reformed cyclic structure, and fragmentation (CO loss) over much longer timescales.',\n",
       " 'Metis is the first solar coronagraph designed for a space mission capable of performing simultaneous imaging of the off-limb solar corona in both visible and UV light. The observations obtained with Metis aboard the Solar Orbiter ESA-NASA observatory will enable us to diagnose, with unprecedented temporal coverage and spatial resolution, the structures and dynamics of the full corona from 1.7 $R_\\\\odot$ to about 9 $R_\\\\odot$. Due to the uniqueness of the Solar Orbiter mission profile, Metis will be able to observe the solar corona from a close vantage point (down to 0.28 AU), achieving out-of-ecliptic views with the increase of the orbit inclination over time. Moreover, observations near perihelion, during the phase of lower rotational velocity of the solar surface relative to the spacecraft, will allow longer-term studies of the coronal features. Thanks to a novel occultation design and a combination of a UV interference coating of the mirrors and a spectral bandpass filter, Metis images the solar corona simultaneously in the visible light band, between 580 and 640 nm, and in the UV H I Lyman-α line at 121.6 nm. The coronal images in both the UV Lyman-α and polarised visible light are obtained at high spatial resolution with a spatial scale down to about 2000 km and 15000 km at perihelion, in the cases of the visible and UV light, respectively. A temporal resolution down to 1 second can be achieved when observing coronal fluctuations in visible light. The Metis measurements will allow for complete characterisation of the main physical parameters and dynamics of the electron and neutral hydrogen/proton plasma components of the corona in the region where the solar wind undergoes acceleration and where the onset and initial propagation of coronal mass ejections take place, thus significantly improving our understanding of the region connecting the Sun to the heliosphere.',\n",
       " 'We revisit the analysis of the bright multiplanet system K2-93, discovered with data taken by the K2 mission. This system contains five identified planets ranging in size from sub-Neptune to Jupiter size. The K2 data available at the discovery of the system only showed single transits for the three outer planets, which allowed weak constraints to be put on their periods. As these planets are interesting candidates for future atmospheric studies, a better characterization of the host star and tighter constraints on their orbital periods are essential. Using new data from the K2 mission taken after the discovery of the system, we perform an asteroseismic characterization of the host star. We are able to place strong constraints on the stellar parameters and obtain a value for the stellar mass of $1.22^{+0.03}_{-0.02}\\\\, \\\\rm M_{\\\\odot}$, a stellar radius of $1.30\\\\pm 0.01\\\\, \\\\rm R_{\\\\odot}$, and an age of $2.07^{+0.36}_{-0.27}$ Gyr.

       " 'We present isochrone ages and initial bulk metallicities ($\\\\rm [Fe/H]_{bulk}$, by accounting for diffusion) of 163,722 stars from the GALAH Data Release 2, mainly composed of main sequence turn-off stars and subgiants ($\\\\rm 7000 K>T_{eff}>4000 K$ and $\\\\rm log g>3$ dex). The local age-metallicity relationship (AMR) is nearly flat but with significant scatter at all ages; the scatter is even higher when considering the observed surface abundances. After correcting for selection effects, the AMR appear to have intrinsic structures indicative of two star formation events, which we speculate are connected to the thin and thick disks in the solar neighborhood. We also present abundance ratio trends for 16 elements as a function of age, across different $\\\\rm [Fe/H]_{bulk}$ bins. In general, we find the trends in terms of [X/Fe] vs age from our far larger sample to be compatible with studies based on small ($\\\\sim$ 100 stars) samples of solar twins but we now extend it to both sub- and super-solar metallicities. The $α$-elements show differing behaviour: the hydrostatic $α$-elements O and Mg show a steady decline with time for all metallicities while the explosive $α$-elements Si, Ca and Ti are nearly constant during the thin disk epoch (ages $\\\\lessapprox $ 12 Gyr). The s-process elements Y and Ba show increasing [X/Fe] with time while the r-process element Eu have the opposite trend, thus favouring a primary production from sources with a short time-delay such as core-collapse supernovae over long-delay events such as neutron star mergers.',\n",

However, rotatable data such as molecules, living cells, everyday objects, or galaxies require processing with equivariance/invariance under rotations in cases where the rotation of the coordinate system does not affect the meaning of the data (e.g. object classification). On the other hand, estimation/processing of rotations is necessary in cases where rotations are important (e.g. motion estimation). There has been recent progress in methods and theory in all these regards. Here we provide an overview of existing methods, both for 2D and 3D rotations (and translations), and identify commonalities and links between them, in the hope that our insights will be useful for choosing and perfecting the methods.',\n",

       " 'It has been argued that current saturation in graphene field-effect transistors (GFETs) is needed to get the highest possible maximum oscillation frequency (fmax). This paper numerically investigates whether velocity saturation can help to get better current saturation and if that correlates with enhanced fmax. For such a purpose, we used a drift-diffusion simulator that includes several factors that influence output conductance, especially at short channel lengths and-or large drain bias: short-channel electrostatics, saturation velocity, graphene-dielectric interface traps, and self-heating effects. As a testbed for our investigation, we analyzed fabricated GFETs with high extrinsin cutoff frequency fT,x (34 GHz) and fmax (37 GHz). Our simulations allow for a microscopic (local) analysis of the channel parameteres such as carrier concentration, drift and saturation velocities. For biases far away from the Dirac voltage, where the channel behaves as unipolar, we confirmed that the higher is the drift velocity, as close as possible to the saturation velocity, the greater fmax is. However, the largest fmax is recorded at biases near the crossover between unipolar and bipolar behavior, where it does not hold that the highest drift velocity maximizes fmax. In fact, the position and magnitude of the largest fmax depend on the complex interplay between the carrier concentration and total velocity which, in turn, are impacted by the self-heating. Importantly, this effect was found to severely limit radio-frequency performance, reducing the maximum fmax from around 60 to 40 GHz.',\n",
       " 'Here we report on a novel High Harmonic Generation (HHG) light source designed for space charge free ultrafast photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) on solids.

These results have been obtained at a photon energy of 16.9 eV with a pulse bandwidth of ~19 meV, by varying, up to 200 kHz, the photon pulses repetition rate and the photon fluence on the sample. These features set a new benchmark for tunable narrowband HHG sources. By comparing the PES energy resolution and the photon pulse bandwidth with a pulse duration of ~105 fs, as retrieved from time-resolved (TR) angle resolved (AR) PES experiments on Bi$_2$Se$_3$, we validate a way for a space charge free photoelectric process close to Fourier transform limit conditions for ultrafast TR-PES experiments on solids.',\n",

In SL MoS$_2$ we find a significant masking of intensity outside the first Brillouin zone, which originates from an in-plane interference effect between photoelectrons emitted from the Mo $d$ orbitals. In BL MoS$_2$ an additional inter-layer interference effect leads to a distinctive modulation of intensity with photon energy. Finally, we use the semiconductor Bloch equations to model the optical excitation in a time- and angle-resolved pump-probe photoemission experiment.

We model the polarization-dependent photoemission intensity in the transiently-populated conduction band using the semiconductor Bloch equations and show that the observed dichroism emerges from intralayer single-particle effects within the isotropic part of the dispersion. This leads to optical excitations with an anisotropic momentum-dependence in an otherwise inversion symmetric material.',\n",
       " 'Sterile neutrinos emerge in minimal extensions of the Standard Model which can solve a number of open questions in astroparticle physics. For example, sterile neutrinos in the keV-mass range are viable dark matter candidates. Their existence would lead to a kink-like distortion in the tritium $β$-decay spectrum. In this work we report about the instrumentation of the Troitsk nu-mass experiment with a 7-pixel TRISTAN prototype detector and measurements in both differential and integral mode. The combination of the two modes is a key requirement for a precise sterile neutrino search, as both methods are prone to largely different systematic uncertainties. Thanks to the excellent performance of the TRISTAN detector at high rates, a sterile neutrino search up to masses of about 6 keV could be performed, which enlarges the previous accessible mass range by a factor of 3. Upper limits on the neutrino mixing amplitude in the mass range < 5.6 keV (differential) and < 6.6 keV (integral) are presented. These results demonstrate the feasibility of a sterile neutrino search as planned in the upgrade of the KATRIN experiment with the final TRISTAN detector and read-out system.',\n",
       " 'Deep neural networks are known to be fragile to small adversarial perturbations. This issue becomes more critical when a neural network is interconnected with a physical system in a closed loop. In this paper, we show how to combine recent works on neural network certification tools (which are mainly used in static settings such as image classification) with robust control theory to certify a neural network policy in a control loop. Specifically, we give a sufficient condition and an algorithm to ensure that the closed loop state and control constraints are satisfied when the persistent adversarial perturbation is l-infinity norm bounded. Our method is based on finding a positively invariant set of the closed loop dynamical system, and thus we do not require the differentiability or the continuity of the neural network policy. Along with the verification result, we also develop an effective attack strategy for neural network control systems that outperforms exhaustive Monte-Carlo search significantly. We show that our certification algorithm works well on learned models and achieves 5 times better result than the traditional Lipschitz-based method to certify the robustness of a neural network policy on a cart pole control problem.',\n",
       " 'The Sr~{\\\\sc i} 4607~Å spectral line shows one of the strongest scattering polarization signals in the visible solar spectrum. The amplitude of this polarization signal is expected to vary at granular spatial scales, due to the combined action of the Hanle effect and the local anisotropy of the radiation field. Observing these variations would be of great interest because it would provide precious information on the small-scale activity of the solar photosphere. At present, few detections of such spatial variations have been reported.

       " 'CSIDH is a recent quantum-resistant primitive based on the difficulty of finding isogeny paths between supersingular curves. Recently, two constant-time versions of CSIDH have been proposed: first by Meyer, Campos and Reith, and then by Onuki, Aikawa, Yamazaki and Takagi. While both offer protection against timing attacks and simple power consumption analysis, they are vulnerable to more powerful attacks such as fault injections. In this work, we identify and repair two oversights in these algorithms that compromised their constant-time character. By exploiting Edwards arithmetic and optimal addition chains, we produce the fastest constant-time version of CSIDH to date. We then consider the stronger attack scenario of fault injection, which is relevant for the security of CSIDH static keys in embedded hardware. We propose and evaluate a dummy-free CSIDH algorithm. While these CSIDH variants are slower, their performance is still within a small constant factor of less-protected variants. Finally, we discuss derandomized CSIDH algorithms.',\n",

       " 'The thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect presents a relatively new tool for characterizing galaxy cluster merger shocks, traditionally studied through X-ray observations. Widely regarded as the \"textbook example\" of a cluster merger bow shock, the western shock front in the Bullet Cluster (1E0657-56) represents the ideal test case for such an SZ study. We aim to reconstruct a parametric model for the shock SZ signal by directly and jointly fitting deep, high-resolution interferometric data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and Atacama Compact Array (ACA) in Fourier space. The ALMA+ACA data are primarily sensitive to the electron pressure difference across the shock front. To estimate the shock Mach number $M$, this difference can be combined with the value for the upstream electron pressure derived from an independent Chandra X-ray analysis. In the case of instantaneous electron-ion temperature equilibration, we find $M=2.08^{+0.12}_{-0.12}$, in $\\\\approx 2.4σ$ tension with the independent constraint from Chandra, $M_X=2.74\\\\pm0.25$. The assumption of purely adiabatic electron temperature change across the shock leads to $M=2.53^{+0.33}_{-0.25}$, in better agreement with the X-ray estimate $M_X=2.57\\\\pm0.23$ derived for the same heating scenario. We have demonstrated that interferometric observations of the SZ effect provide constraints on the properties of the shock in the Bullet Cluster that are highly complementary to X-ray observations. The combination of X-ray and SZ data yields a powerful probe of the shock properties, capable of measuring $M$ and addressing the question of electron-ion equilibration in cluster shocks. Our analysis is however limited by systematics related to the overall cluster geometry and the complexity of the post-shock gas distribution. To overcome these limitations, a joint analysis of SZ and X-ray data is needed.',\n",

       " 'Conventional impurity doping of deep nanoscale silicon (dns-Si) used in ultra large scale integration (ULSI) faces serious challenges below the 14 nm technology node. We report on a new fundamental effect in theory and experiment, namely the electronic structure of dns-Si experiencing energy offsets of ca. 1 eV as a function of SiO$_2$- vs. Si$_3$N$_4$-embedding with a few monolayers (MLs). An interface charge transfer (ICT) from dns-Si specific to the anion type of the dielectric is at the core of this effect and arguably nested in quantum-chemical properties of oxygen (O) and nitrogen (N) vs. Si. We investigate the size up to which this energy offset defines the electronic structure of dns-Si by density functional theory (DFT), considering interface orientation, embedding layer thickness, and approximants featuring two Si nanocrystals (NCs); one embedded in SiO$_2$ and the other in Si$_3$N$_4$. Working with synchrotron ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), we use SiO$_2$- vs. Si$_3$N$_4$-embedded Si nanowells (NWells) to obtain their energy of the top valence band states. These results confirm our theoretical findings and gauge an analytic model for projecting maximum dns-Si sizes for NCs, nanowires (NWires) and NWells where the energy offset reaches full scale, yielding to a clear preference for electrons or holes as majority carriers in dns-Si. Our findings can replace impurity doping for n/p-type dns-Si as used in ultra-low power electronics and ULSI, eliminating dopant-related issues such as inelastic carrier scattering, thermal ionization, clustering, out-diffusion and defect generation. As far as majority carrier preference is concerned, the elimination of those issues effectively shifts the lower size limit of Si-based ULSI devices to the crystalization limit of Si of ca. 1.5 nm and enables them to work also under cryogenic conditions.',\n",

       " \"We show that a black hole surrounded by scalar dark matter develops scalar hair. This is the generalization of a phenomenon pointed out by Jacobson, that a minimally coupled scalar with a non-trivial time dependence far away from the black hole would endow the black hole with hair. In our case, the time dependence arises from the oscillation of a scalar field with a non-zero mass. We systematically explore the scalar profile around the black hole for different scalar masses. In the small mass limit, the scalar field has a $1/r$ component at large radius $r$, consistent with Jacobson's result. In the large mass limit (with the Compton wavelength of order of the horizon or smaller), the scalar field has a $1/r^{3/4}$ profile yielding a pile-up close to the horizon, while distinctive nodes occur for intermediate masses. Thus, the dark matter profile around a black hole, while challenging to measure, contains information about the dark matter particle mass. As an application, we consider the case of the supermassive black hole at the center of M87, recently imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope. Its horizon size is roughly the Compton wavelength of a scalar particle of mass $10^{-20}$ eV. We consider the implications of the expected scalar pile-up close to the horizon, for fuzzy dark matter at a mass of $10^{-20}$ eV or below.\",\n",
       " 'Theory suggests that there are two primary modes of accretion through which dark matter halos acquire the gas to form and fuel galaxies, hot and cold mode accretion. In cold mode accretion, gas streams along cosmic web filaments to the center of the halo, allowing for the efficient delivery of star-forming fuel. Recently, two QSO-illuminated HI Lyman alpha (Lyα) emitting objects were reported to have properties of cold, rotating structures (Martin et al. 2015, Martin et al. 2016). However, the spatial and spectral resolution available was insufficient to constrain radial flows associated with connecting filaments. With the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) we now have eight times the spatial resolution, permitting the detection of these in-spiraling flows. In order to detect these inflows, we introduce a suite of models which incorporate zonal radial flows, demonstrate their performance on a numerical simulation that exhibits coldflow accretion, and show that they are an excellent match to KCWI velocity maps of two Lyα emitters observed around high-redshift quasars. These Multi-Filament Inflow models kinematically isolate zones of radial inflow that correspond to extended filamentary emission. The derived gas flux and inflow path is sufficient to fuel the inferred central galaxy star formation rate and angular momentum. Thus, our kinematic emission maps provide strong evidence for the inflow of gas from the cosmic web building galaxies at the peak of star formation.',\n",

       " 'Sr I 4607Åspectral line shows one of the strongest scattering polarization signals in the visible solar spectrum. The amplitudes of these signals are expected to vary at granular spatial scales. This variation can be due to changes in the magnetic field intensity and orientation (Hanle effect) as well as due to spatial and temporal variations in the plasma properties. Measuring the spatial variation of such polarization signal would allow us to study the properties of the magnetic fields at subgranular region. But, the observations are challenging since both high spatial resolution and high spectropolarimetric sensitivity are required at the same time. To the aim of measuring these spatial variations at granular scale, we carried out a spectro-polarimetric measurement with the Zurich IMaging POLarimeter (ZIMPOL), at the GREGOR solar telescope at different limb distances on solar disk. Our results show a spatial variation of scattering linear polarization signals in Sr I 4607Åline at the granular scale at every $μ$, starting from 0.2 to 0.8. The correlation between the polarization signal amplitude and the continuum intensity imply statistically that the scattering polarization is higher at the granular regions than in the intergranular lanes.',\n",

       " 'We report the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) discovery of three terrestrial-sized planets transiting L 98-59 (TOI-175, TIC 307210830) -- a bright M dwarf at a distance of 10.6 pc. Using the Gaia-measured distance and broad-band photometry we find that the host star is an M3 dwarf. Combined with the TESS transits from three sectors, the corresponding stellar parameters yield planet radii ranging from 0.8REarth to 1.6REarth. All three planets have short orbital periods, ranging from 2.25 to 7.45 days with the outer pair just wide of a 2:1 period resonance. Diagnostic tests produced by the TESS Data Validation Report and the vetting package DAVE rule out common false positive sources. These analyses, along with dedicated follow-up and the multiplicity of the system, lend confidence that the observed signals are caused by planets transiting L 98-59 and are not associated with other sources in the field. The L 98-59 system is interesting for a number of reasons: the host star is bright (V = 11.7 mag, K = 7.1 mag) and the planets are prime targets for further follow-up observations including precision radial-velocity mass measurements and future transit spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope; the near resonant configuration makes the system a laboratory to study planetary system dynamical evolution; and three planets of relatively similar size in the same system present an opportunity to study terrestrial planets where other variables (age, metallicity, etc.) can be held constant. L 98-59 will be observed in 4 more TESS sectors, which will provide a wealth of information on the three currently known planets and have the potential to reveal additional planets in the system.',\n",
       " 'This paper briefly reviews a number of fundamental measurements that need to be made in order to characterize turbulence in space plasmas such as the solar wind. It has long been known that many of these quantities require simultaneous multipoint measurements to attain a proper characterization that would reveal the fundamental physics of plasma turbulence. The solar wind is an ideal plasma for such an investigation, and it now appears to be technologically feasible to carry out such an investigation, following the pioneering Cluster and MMS missions. Quantities that need to be measured using multipoint measurements include the two-point, two-time second correlation function of velocity, magnetic field and density, and higher order statistical objects such as third and fourth order structure functions. Some details of these requirements are given here, with a eye towards achieving closure on fundamental questions regarding the cascade rate, spectral anisotropy, characteristic coherent structures, intermittency, and dissipation mechanisms that describe plasma turbuelence, as well as its variability with plasma parameters in the solar wind. The motivation for this discussion is the current planning for a proposed Helioswarm mission that would be designed to make these measurements,leading to breakthrough understanding of the physics of space and astrophysical turbulence.',\n",

These observed processes are understood under the framework of disk-planet interaction, a process studied analytically and modeled numerically for over 40 years. Long a theoreticians' game, the wealth of observational data has been allowing for increasingly stringent tests of the theoretical models. Modeling efforts are crucial to support the interpretation of direct imaging analyses, not just for potential detections but also to put meaningful upper limits on mass accretion rates and other physical quantities in current and future large-scale surveys. This white paper addresses the questions of what efforts on the computational side are required in the next decade to advance our theoretical understanding, explain the observational data, and guide new observations. We identified the nature of accretion, ab initio planet formation, early evolution, and circumplanetary disks as major fields of interest in computational planet formation. We recommend that modelers relax the approximations of alpha-viscosity and isothermal equations of state, on the grounds that these models use flawed assumptions, even if they give good visual qualitative agreement with observations. We similarly recommend that population synthesis move away from 1D hydrodynamics. The computational resources to reach these goals should be developed during the next decade, through improvements in algorithms and the hardware for hybrid CPU/GPU clusters. Coupled with high angular resolution and great line sensitivity in ground based interferometers, ELTs and JWST, these advances in computational efforts should allow for large strides in the field in the next decade.\",\n",

Two dimming events of similar depth and duration were seen in 2008 (WASP) and 2011 (KELT), consistent with an object in a closed periodic orbit. In this paper we present data from a ground-based observing campaign designed to measure the star both photometrically and spectroscopically during the time of predicted eclipse in September 2017. Despite high-quality photometry, the predicted eclipse did not occur, although coherent structure is present suggesting variable amounts of stellar flux or dust obscuration. We also searched for RV oscillations caused by any hypothetical companion and can rule out close binaries to 0.1 $M_\\\\odot$. A search of Sonneberg plate archive data also enabled us to extend the photometric baseline of this star back more than 50 years, and similarly does not re-detect any deep eclipses. Taken together, they suggest that the eclipses seen in WASP and KELT photometry were due to aperiodic events. It would seem that PDS 110 undergoes stochastic dimmings that are shallower and shorter-duration than those of UX Ori variables, but may have a similar mechanism.',\n",
       " \"Nearly all young stars are initially surrounded by `protoplanetary' discs of gas and dust, and in the case of single stars at least 30\\\\% of these discs go on to form planets. The process of protoplanetary disc formation can result in initial misalignments, where the disc orbital plane is different to the stellar equator in single star systems, or to the binary orbital plane in systems with two stars. A quirk of the dynamics means that initially misaligned `circumbinary' discs -- those that surround two stars -- are predicted to evolve to one of two possible stable configurations, one where the disc and binary orbital planes are coplanar, and one where they are perpendicular (a `polar' configuration). Prior work has found coplanar circumbinary discs, but no polar examples were known until now. Here we report the first discovery of a protoplanetary circumbinary disc in the polar configuration, supporting the predictions that such discs should exist. The disc shows some characteristics that are similar to discs around single stars, and that are attributed to dust growth. Thus, the first stages of planet formation appear able to proceed in polar circumbinary discs.\",\n",

       " \"With deep neural networks providing state-of-the-art machine learning models for numerous machine learning tasks, quantifying the robustness of these models has become an important area of research. However, most of the research literature merely focuses on the \\\\textit{worst-case} setting where the input of the neural network is perturbed with noises that are constrained within an $\\\\ell_p$ ball; and several algorithms have been proposed to compute certified lower bounds of minimum adversarial distortion based on such worst-case analysis. In this paper, we address these limitations and extend the approach to a \\\\textit{probabilistic} setting where the additive noises can follow a given distributional characterization. We propose a novel probabilistic framework PROVEN to PRObabilistically VErify Neural networks with statistical guarantees -- i.e., PROVEN certifies the probability that the classifier's top-1 prediction cannot be altered under any constrained $\\\\ell_p$ norm perturbation to a given input. Importantly, we show that it is possible to derive closed-form probabilistic certificates based on current state-of-the-art neural network robustness verification frameworks. Hence, the probabilistic certificates provided by PROVEN come naturally and with almost no overhead when obtaining the worst-case certified lower bounds from existing methods such as Fast-Lin, CROWN and CNN-Cert. Experiments on small and large MNIST and CIFAR neural network models demonstrate our probabilistic approach can achieve up to around $75\\\\%$ improvement in the robustness certification with at least a $99.99\\\\%$ confidence compared with the worst-case robustness certificate delivered by CROWN.\",\n",
       " 'Verifying robustness of neural network classifiers has attracted great interests and attention due to the success of deep neural networks and their unexpected vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. Although finding minimum adversarial distortion of neural networks (with ReLU activations) has been shown to be an NP-complete problem, obtaining a non-trivial lower bound of minimum distortion as a provable robustness guarantee is possible. However, most previous works only focused on simple fully-connected layers (multilayer perceptrons) and were limited to ReLU activations. This motivates us to propose a general and efficient framework, CNN-Cert, that is capable of certifying robustness on general convolutional neural networks. Our framework is general -- we can handle various architectures including convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, batch normalization layer, residual blocks, as well as general activation functions; our approach is efficient -- by exploiting the special structure of convolutional layers, we achieve up to 17 and 11 times of speed-up compared to the state-of-the-art certification algorithms (e.g. Fast-Lin, CROWN) and 366 times of speed-up compared to the dual-LP approach while our algorithm obtains similar or even better verification bounds. In addition, CNN-Cert generalizes state-of-the-art algorithms e.g. Fast-Lin and CROWN. We demonstrate by extensive experiments that our method outperforms state-of-the-art lower-bound-based certification algorithms in terms of both bound quality and speed.',\n",
       " 'The transition from monolayers to multilayered structures in bacterial colonies is a fundamental step in biofilm development. Observed across different morphotypes and species, this transition is triggered within freely growing bacterial microcolonies comprising a few hundred cells. Using a combination of numerical simulations and analytical modeling, here we demonstrate that this transition originates from the competition between growth-induced in-plane active stresses and vertical restoring forces, due to the cell-substrate interactions. Using a simple chain-like colony of laterally confined cells, we show that the transition is triggered by the mechanical instability of individual cells, thus it is localized and mechanically deterministic. Asynchronous cell division renders the process stochastic, so that all the critical parameters that control the onset of the transition are continuously distributed random variables. Upon modeling cell division as a Poisson process, we can approximately calculate the probability distribution function of the position and time associated with the first extrusion. The rate of such a Poisson process can be identified as the order parameter of the transition, thus highlighting its mixed deterministic/stochastic nature.',\n",

Values of the electron-phonon coupling parameter $λ$ are obtained by measuring the linewidth of the spin-split bands as a function of temperature and fitting the data points using a Debye model. The experimental values of $λ$ for the upper and lower spin-split bands at K are found to be 0.05 and 0.32, respectively, in excellent agreement with the calculated values for a free-standing single-layer MoS$_2$. The results are discussed in the context of spin and phase-space restricted scattering channels, as reported earlier for single-layer WS$_2$ on Au(111). The fact that the absolute valence band maximum in single-layer MoS$_2$ at K is almost degenerate with the local valence band maximum at $Γ$ can potentially be used to tune the strength of the electron-phonon interaction in this material.',\n",
       " 'Finding minimum distortion of adversarial examples and thus certifying robustness in neural network classifiers for given data points is known to be a challenging problem. Nevertheless, recently it has been shown to be possible to give a non-trivial certified lower bound of minimum adversarial distortion, and some recent progress has been made towards this direction by exploiting the piece-wise linear nature of ReLU activations. However, a generic robustness certification for general activation functions still remains largely unexplored. To address this issue, in this paper we introduce CROWN, a general framework to certify robustness of neural networks with general activation functions for given input data points. The novelty in our algorithm consists of bounding a given activation function with linear and quadratic functions, hence allowing it to tackle general activation functions including but not limited to four popular choices: ReLU, tanh, sigmoid and arctan. In addition, we facilitate the search for a tighter certified lower bound by adaptively selecting appropriate surrogates for each neuron activation. Experimental results show that CROWN on ReLU networks can notably improve the certified lower bounds compared to the current state-of-the-art algorithm Fast-Lin, while having comparable computational efficiency. Furthermore, CROWN also demonstrates its effectiveness and flexibility on networks with general activation functions, including tanh, sigmoid and arctan.',\n",

Iron is the most abundant transition metal, but has never been directly detected in an exoplanet due to its highly refractory nature. KELT-9b (HD 195689b) is the archetype of the class of ultra-hot Jupiters that straddle the transition between stars and gas-giant exoplanets and serve as distinctive laboratories for studying atmospheric chemistry, because of its high equilibrium temperature of 4050 +/- 180 K.

The X-IFU is based on a large format array of super-conducting molybdenum-gold Transition Edge Sensors cooled at about 90 mK, each coupled with an absorber made of gold and bismuth with a pitch of 249 microns. A cryogenic anti-coincidence detector located underneath the prime TES array enables the non X-ray background to be reduced.

Frequency domain multiplexing enables to read out 40 pixels in one single channel. A photon interacting with an absorber leads to a current pulse, amplified by the readout electronics and whose shape is reconstructed on board to recover its energy with high accuracy. The defocusing capability offered by the Athena movable mirror assembly enables the X-IFU to observe the brightest X-ray sources of the sky (up to Crab-like intensities) by spreading the telescope point spread function over hundreds of pixels.

Here, we introduce an alternative approach that allows an impartial, high resolution, hands-off decomposition of the brain waves into a small number of discrete, frequency-modulated oscillatory processes, which we call oscillons. In particular, we demonstrate that mouse hippocampal LFP contain a single oscillon that occupies the $θ$-frequency band and a couple of $γ$-oscillons that correspond, respectively, to slow and fast $γ$-waves. Since the oscillons were identified empirically, they may represent the actual, physical structure of synchronous oscillations in neuronal ensembles, whereas Fourier-defined \"brain waves\" are nothing but poorly resolved oscillons.',\n",

Here we report the first realization of single-layer VS2, which we have prepared epitaxially with high quality on Au(111) in the octahedral (1T) structure. We find that we can deplete the VS2 lattice of S by annealing in vacuum so as to create an entirely new two-dimensional compound that has no bulk analogue.

Herein, we demonstrate the frequency of variable-region glycosylation in single-cell cloned mAbs. A total of 14 ACPA mAbs were evaluated for predicted N-linked glycosylation motifs in silico and compared to 452 highly-mutated mAbs from RA patients and controls. Variable region N-linked motifs (N-X-S/T) were strikingly prevalent within ACPA (100%) compared to somatically hypermutated (SHM) RA bone marrow plasma cells (21%), and synovial plasma cells from seropositive (39%) and seronegative RA (7%). When normalized for SHM, ACPA still had significantly higher frequency of N-linked motifs compared to all studied mAbs including highly-mutated HIV broadly-neutralizing and malaria-associated mAbs. The Fab glycans of ACPA-mAbs were highly sialylated, contributed to altered charge, but did not influence antigen binding. The analysis revealed evidence of unusual B-cell selection pressure and SHM-mediated decreased in surface charge and isoelectric point in ACPA. It is still unknown how these distinct features of anti-citrulline immunity may have an impact on pathogenesis. However, it is evident that they offer selective advantages for ACPA+ B cells, possibly also through non-antigen driven mechanisms.',\n",
       " 'Quantum teleportation establishes a correspondence between an entangled state shared by two separate par- ties that can communicate classically and the presence of a quantum channel connecting the two parties. The standard benchmark for quantum teleportation, based on the average fidelity between the input and output states, indicates that some entangled states do not lead to channels which can be certified to be quantum. It was re- cently shown that if one considers a finer-tuned witness, then all entangled states can be certified to produce a non-classical teleportation channel. Here we experimentally demonstrate a complete characterization of a new family of such witnesses, of the type proposed in Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 110501 (2017) under different con- ditions of noise. Furthermore, we show non-classical teleportation using quantum states that can not achieve average teleportation fidelity above the classical limit. Our results have fundamental implications in quantum information protocols and may also lead to new applications and quality certification of quantum technologies.',\n",
       " 'Using GALAH survey data of nearby stars, we look at how structure in the planar (u,v) velocity distribution depends on metallicity and on viewing direction within the Galaxy. In nearby stars, with distance d < 1 kpc, the Hercules stream is most strongly seen in higher metallicity stars [Fe/H] > 0.2. The Hercules stream peak v value depends on viewed galactic longitude, which we interpret as due to the gap between the stellar stream and more circular orbits being associated with a specific angular momentum value of about 1640 km/s kpc. The association of the gap with a particular angular momentum value supports a bar resonant model for the Hercules stream.\\n  Moving groups previously identified in Hipparcos observations are easiest to see in stars nearer than 250 pc, and their visibility and peak velocities in the velocity distributions depends on both viewing direction (galactic longitude and hemisphere) and metallicity. We infer that there is fine structure in local velocity distributions that varies over distances of a few hundred pc in the Galaxy.',\n",

The assignment of different C 1s and Ru 3d core level components and their evolution during the growth process gives a detailed insight into the graphene formation and the strongly varying graphene-Ru interaction strength within the large moire unit cell. Subsequent intercalation of oxygen can be achieved at elevated temperature and the core level spectra show a conversion of the strongly corrugated to quasi free-standing graphene, characterised by a single narrow C 1s component. This conversion and the accompanying flattening of the graphene layer is also confirmed by x-ray photoelectron diffraction. The effect of oxygen intercalation on the electronic structure is studied using angle-resolved photoemission of the valence band states. For graphene/Ru(0001), the strong graphene-substrate hybridisation disrupts the π-band dispersion but oxygen intercalation fully restores the π-band with a strong p-doping that shifts the Dirac point 785 meV above the Fermi level. The doping of the system is highly tunable, as the additional exposure to rubidium can convert the carrier filling to n-type with the Dirac point 970 meV below the Fermi level.',\n",
       " 'The robustness of neural networks to adversarial examples has received great attention due to security implications. Despite various attack approaches to crafting visually imperceptible adversarial examples, little has been developed towards a comprehensive measure of robustness. In this paper, we provide a theoretical justification for converting robustness analysis into a local Lipschitz constant estimation problem, and propose to use the Extreme Value Theory for efficient evaluation. Our analysis yields a novel robustness metric called CLEVER, which is short for Cross Lipschitz Extreme Value for nEtwork Robustness. The proposed CLEVER score is attack-agnostic and computationally feasible for large neural networks. Experimental results on various networks, including ResNet, Inception-v3 and MobileNet, show that (i) CLEVER is aligned with the robustness indication measured by the $\\\\ell_2$ and $\\\\ell_\\\\infty$ norms of adversarial examples from powerful attacks, and (ii) defended networks using defensive distillation or bounded ReLU indeed achieve better CLEVER scores. To the best of our knowledge, CLEVER is the first attack-independent robustness metric that can be applied to any neural network classifier.',\n",

Each base station (BS) is randomly deployed within a given area and is equipped with $M$ antennas to serve $K$ user equipments (UEs). A multislope (distance-dependent) path loss model is considered and linear processing is used, under the assumption that channel state information is acquired by using pilot sequences (reused across the network). Within this setting, a lower bound on the UL spectral efficiency and a realistic circuit power consumption model are used to evaluate the network EE. Numerical results are first used to compute the optimal BS density and pilot reuse factor for a Massive MIMO network with three different detection schemes, namely, maximum ratio combining, zero-forcing (ZF) and multicell minimum mean-squared error. The numerical analysis shows that the EE is a unimodal function of BS density and achieves its maximum for a relatively small density of BS, irrespective of the employed detection scheme. This is in contrast to the single-slope (distance-independent) path loss model, for which the EE is a monotonic non-decreasing function of BS density. Then, we concentrate on ZF and use stochastic geometry to compute a new lower bound on the spectral efficiency, which is then used to optimize, for a given BS density, the pilot reuse factor, number of BS antennas and UEs. Closed- form expressions are computed from which valuable insights into the interplay between optimization variables, hardware characteristics, and propagation environment are obtained.',\n",

We find that the presence of droplets on the growth surface strongly affects the adatom incorporation dynamics, making the growth rate a decreasing function of the overall metal flux impinging on the surface as soon as the metal dose exceeds the critical amount required for the nucleation of droplets. We explain this phenomenon via a model that takes into account droplet effects on the incorporation of metal adatoms into the crystal. A relevant role is played by the vapor-liquid-solid growth mode that takes place under the droplets due to nitrogen molecules directly impinging on the droplets.',\n",
       " 'Solving inverse problems is central to geosciences and remote sensing. Radiative transfer models (RTMs) represent mathematically the physical laws which govern the phenomena in remote sensing applications (forward models). The numerical inversion of the RTM equations is a challenging and computationally demanding problem, and for this reason, often the application of a nonlinear statistical regression is preferred. In general, regression models predict the biophysical parameter of interest from the corresponding received radiance. However, this approach does not employ the physical information encoded in the RTMs. An alternative strategy, which attempts to include the physical knowledge, consists in learning a regression model trained using data simulated by an RTM code. In this work, we introduce a nonlinear nonparametric regression model which combines the benefits of the two aforementioned approaches. The inversion is performed taking into account jointly both real observations and RTM-simulated data. The proposed Joint Gaussian Process (JGP) provides a solid framework for exploiting the regularities between the two types of data. The JGP automatically detects the relative quality of the simulated and real data, and combines them accordingly. This occurs by learning an additional hyper-parameter w.r.t. a standard GP model, and fitting parameters through maximizing the pseudo-likelihood of the real observations. The resulting scheme is both simple and robust, i.e., capable of adapting to different scenarios. The advantages of the JGP method compared to benchmark strategies are shown considering RTM-simulated and real observations in different experiments. Specifically, we consider leaf area index (LAI) retrieval from Landsat data combined with simulated data generated by the PROSAIL model.',\n",

However, the fraction of the entanglement-ready quantum dots that can be fabricated with this method is still limited to around 5%, and matching the energy of the entangled photons to atomic transitions (a promising route towards quantum networking) remains an outstanding challenge.\\n  Here, we overcome these obstacles by introducing a modified approach to droplet epitaxy on a high symmetry (111)A substrate, where the fundamental crystallization step is performed at a significantly higher temperature as compared to previous reports. Our method drastically improves the yield of entanglement-ready photon sources near the emission wavelength of interest, which can be as high as 95% due to the low values of fine structure splitting and radiative lifetime, together with the reduced exciton dephasing offered by the choice of GaAs/AlGaAs materials. The quantum dots are designed to emit in the operating spectral region of Rb-based slow-light media, providing a viable technology for quantum repeater stations.',\n",

       " 'Next generation wireless networks aim at providing substantial improvements in spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE). Massive MIMO has been proved to be a viable technology to achieve these goals by spatially multiplexing several users using many base station (BS) antennas. A potential limitation of Massive MIMO in multicell systems is pilot contamination, which arises in the channel estimation process from the interference caused by reusing pilots in neighboring cells. A standard method to reduce pilot contamination, known as regular pilot (RP), is to adjust the length of pilot sequences while transmitting data and pilot symbols disjointly. An alternative method, called superimposed pilot (SP), sends a superposition of pilot and data symbols. This allows to use longer pilots which, in turn, reduces pilot contamination. We consider the uplink of a multicell Massive MIMO network using maximum ratio combining detection and compare RP and SP in terms of SE and EE. To this end, we derive rigorous closed-form achievable rates with SP under a practical random BS deployment. We prove that the reduction of pilot contamination with SP is outweighed by the additional coherent and non-coherent interference. Numerical results show that when both methods are optimized, RP achieves comparable SE and EE to SP in practical scenarios.',\n",

       " 'Lensing of the CMB is now a well-developed probe of large-scale clustering over a broad range of redshifts. By exploiting the non-Gaussian imprints of lensing in the polarization of the CMB, the CORE mission can produce a clean map of the lensing deflections over nearly the full-sky. The number of high-S/N modes in this map will exceed current CMB lensing maps by a factor of 40, and the measurement will be sample-variance limited on all scales where linear theory is valid. Here, we summarise this mission product and discuss the science that it will enable. For example, the summed mass of neutrinos will be determined to an accuracy of 17 meV combining CORE lensing and CMB two-point information with contemporaneous BAO measurements, three times smaller than the minimum total mass allowed by neutrino oscillations. In the search for B-mode polarization from primordial gravitational waves with CORE, lens-induced B-modes will dominate over instrument noise, limiting constraints on the gravitational wave power spectrum amplitude. With lensing reconstructed by CORE, one can \"delens\" the observed polarization internally, reducing the lensing B-mode power by 60%. This improves to 70% by combining lensing and CIB measurements from CORE, reducing the error on the gravitational wave amplitude by 2.5 compared to no delensing (in the null hypothesis). Lensing measurements from CORE will allow calibration of the halo masses of the 40000 galaxy clusters that it will find, with constraints dominated by the clean polarization-based estimators. CORE can accurately remove Galactic emission from CMB maps with its 19 frequency channels. We present initial findings that show that residual Galactic foreground contamination will not be a significant source of bias for lensing power spectrum measurements with CORE. [abridged]',\n",

The emergence of microdomains is mediated by two competing forces: the steric forces between neighboring cells, which favor cell alignment, and the extensile stresses due to cell growth that tend to reduce the local orientational order and thereby distort the system. This interplay results in an exponential distribution of the domain areas and sets a characteristic length scale proportional to the square root of the ratio between the system orientational stiffness and the magnitude of the extensile active stress.

       " 'Fabrication process variations are a major source of yield degradation in the nano-scale design of integrated circuits (IC), microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and photonic circuits. Stochastic spectral methods are a promising technique to quantify the uncertainties caused by process variations. Despite their superior efficiency over Monte Carlo for many design cases, these algorithms suffer from the curse of dimensionality; i.e., their computational cost grows very fast as the number of random parameters increases. In order to solve this challenging problem, this paper presents a high-dimensional uncertainty quantification algorithm from a big-data perspective. Specifically, we show that the huge number of (e.g., $1.5 \\\\times 10^{27}$) simulation samples in standard stochastic collocation can be reduced to a very small one (e.g., $500$) by exploiting some hidden structures of a high-dimensional data array. This idea is formulated as a tensor recovery problem with sparse and low-rank constraints; and it is solved with an alternating minimization approach. Numerical results show that our approach can simulate efficiently some ICs, as well as MEMS and photonic problems with over 50 independent random parameters, whereas the traditional algorithm can only handle several random parameters.',\n",

By applying a hBN-assisted, contamination free, dry transfer process for CVD graphene, high-quality heterostructures with low doping densities and low strain variations are assembled. The Raman spectra of these pristine heterostructures are sensitive to substrate-induced doping and strain variations and are thus used to probe the suitability of the substrate material for potential high-quality graphene devices. We find that the flatness of the substrate material is a key figure for gaining, or preserving high-quality graphene.',\n",
       " 'We present Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy of individual stars in the relatively isolated Local Group dwarf galaxies Leo A, Aquarius, and the Sagittarius dwarf irregular galaxy. The three galaxies--but especially Leo A and Aquarius--share in common delayed star formation histories relative to many other isolated dwarf galaxies. The stars in all three galaxies are supported by dispersion. We found no evidence of stellar velocity structure, even for Aquarius, which has rotating HI gas. The velocity dispersions indicate that all three galaxies are dark matter-dominated, with dark-to-baryonic mass ratios ranging from $4.4^{+1.1}_{-0.8}$ (SagDIG) to $9.6^{+2.5}_{-1.8}$ (Aquarius). Leo A and SagDIG have lower stellar metallicities than Aquarius, and they also have higher gas fractions, both of which would be expected if Aquarius were farther along in its chemical evolution. The metallicity distribution of Leo A is inconsistent with a Closed or Leaky Box model of chemical evolution, suggesting that the galaxy was pre-enriched or acquired external gas during star formation. The metallicities of stars increased steadily for all three galaxies, but possibly at different rates. The [$α$/Fe] ratios at a given [Fe/H] are lower than that of the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy, which indicates more extended star formation histories than Sculptor, consistent with photometrically derived star formation histories. Overall, the bulk kinematic and chemical properties for the late-forming dwarf galaxies do not diverge significantly from those of less delayed dwarf galaxies, including dwarf spheroidal galaxies.',\n",

This phenomenon may be caused by multiple spatial or temporal factors (e.g. 3-D field solvers discretizations and multi-rate circuit simulation), nonlinearity of devices and circuits, large number of design or optimization parameters (e.g. full-chip routing/placement and circuit sizing), or extensive process variations (e.g. variability/reliability analysis and design for manufacturability).

We were able to extract both average seismic parameters and individual mode frequencies for stars with dominant frequencies up to ~3300μHz, and we find that data for some targets are good enough to allow for a measurement of the rotational splitting. Modelling of the extracted parameters is performed by using grid-based methods using average parameters and individual frequencies together with spectroscopic parameters. For the target selection in C3, stars were chosen as in C1 and C2 to cover a wide range in parameter space to better understand the performance and noise characteristics. For C3 we still detected oscillations in 73% of the observed stars that we proposed. Future K2 campaigns hold great promise for the study of nearby clusters and the chemical evolution and age-metallicity relation of nearby field stars in the solar neighbourhood. We expect oscillations to be detected in ~388 short-cadence targets if the K2 mission continues until C18, which will greatly complement the ~500 detections of solar-like oscillations made for short-cadence targets during the nominal Kepler mission.

These observations are compared to the data of the surface detector stations of the Observatory, which provide well-calibrated information on the cosmic-ray energies and arrival directions. The response of the radio stations in the 30 to 80 MHz regime has been thoroughly calibrated to enable the reconstruction of the incoming electric field. For the latter, the energy deposit per area is determined from the radio pulses at each observer position and is interpolated using a two-dimensional function that takes into account signal asymmetries due to interference between the geomagnetic and charge-excess emission components. The spatial integral over the signal distribution gives a direct measurement of the energy transferred from the primary cosmic ray into radio emission in the AERA frequency range. We measure 15.8 MeV of radiation energy for a 1 EeV air shower arriving perpendicularly to the geomagnetic field. This radiation energy -- corrected for geometrical effects -- is used as a cosmic-ray energy estimator. Performing an absolute energy calibration against the surface-detector information, we observe that this radio-energy estimator scales quadratically with the cosmic-ray energy as expected for coherent emission.

       " 'Genotypic fitness landscapes are constructed by assessing the fitness of all possible combinations of a given number of mutations. In the last years, several experimental fitness landscapes have been completely resolved. As fitness landscapes are high-dimensional, their characterization relies on simple measures of their structure, which can be used as statistics in empirical applications. Here we propose two new sets of measures that explicitly capture two relevant features of fitness landscapes: epistasis and constraints. The first set contains new measures for epistasis based on the correlation of fitness effects of mutations. They have a natural interpretation, capture well the interaction between mutations, can be obtained analytically for most landscape models and can therefore be used to discriminate between different models. The second set contains measures of evolutionary constraints based on \"chains\" of forced mutations along fitness-increasing paths. Some of these measures are non-monotonic in the amount of epistatic interactions, but have instead a maximum for intermediate values. We further characterize the relationships of these measures to the ones that were previous proposed (e.g. number of peaks, roughness/slope, fraction of non-additive components, etc). Finally, we show how these measures can help uncovering the amount and the nature of epistatic interactions in two experimental landscapes.',\n",

Compared with the stochastic Galerkin (SG) method, the resulting coupled deterministic equations from our proposed ST method can be solved in a decoupled manner at each time point. At the same time, ST uses fewer samples and allows more flexible time step size controls than directly using a nonintrusive SC solver. These two properties make ST more efficient than SG and than existing SC methods, and more suitable for time-domain circuit simulation.

       " 'Emitters of indistinguishable single photons are crucial for the growing field of quantum technologies. To realize scalability and increase the complexity of quantum optics technologies, multiple independent yet identical single photon emitters are also required. However typical solid-state single photon sources are inherently dissimilar, necessitating the use of electrical feedback or optical cavities to improve spectral overlap between distinct emitters. Here, we demonstrate bright silicon-vacancy (SiV-) centres in low-strain bulk diamond which intrinsically show spectral overlap of up to 91% and near transform-limited excitation linewidths. Our results have impact upon the application of single photon sources for quantum optics and cryptography, and the production of next generation fluorophores for bio-imaging.',\n",

       " 'In this paper, the development of the dual mirror Small Size Telescopes (SST) for the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is reviewed. Up to 70 SST, with a primary mirror diameter of 4 m, will be produced and installed at the CTA southern site. These will allow investigation of the gamma-ray sky at the highest energies accessible to CTA, in the range from about 1 TeV to 300 TeV. The telescope presented in this contribution is characterized by two major innovations: the use of a dual mirror Schwarzschild-Couder configuration and of an innovative camera using as sensors either multi-anode photomultipliers (MAPM) or silicon photomultipliers (SiPM). The reduced plate-scale of the telescope, achieved with the dual-mirror optics, allows the camera to be compact (40 cm in diameter), and low-cost. The camera, which has about 2000 pixels of size 6x6 mm^2, covers a field of view of 10°. The dual mirror telescopes and their cameras are being developed by three consortia, ASTRI (Astrofisica con Specchi a Tecnologia Replicante Italiana, Italy/INAF), GATE (Gamma-ray Telescope Elements, France/Paris Observ.) and CHEC (Compact High Energy Camera, universities in UK, US and Japan) which are merging their efforts in order to finalize an end-to-end design that will be constructed for CTA. A number of prototype structures and cameras are being developed in order to investigate various alternative designs. In this contribution, these designs are presented, along with the technological solutions under study.',\n",

       " 'This White Paper, submitted to the recent ESA call for science themes to define its future large missions, advocates the need for a transformational leap in our understanding of two key questions in astrophysics: 1) How does ordinary matter assemble into the large scale structures that we see today? 2) How do black holes grow and shape the Universe? Hot gas in clusters, groups and the intergalactic medium dominates the baryonic content of the local Universe. To understand the astrophysical processes responsible for the formation and assembly of these large structures, it is necessary to measure their physical properties and evolution. This requires spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy with a factor 10 increase in both telescope throughput and spatial resolving power compared to currently planned facilities. Feedback from supermassive black holes is an essential ingredient in this process and in most galaxy evolution models, but it is not well understood. X-ray observations can uniquely reveal the mechanisms launching winds close to black holes and determine the coupling of the energy and matter flows on larger scales. Due to the effects of feedback, a complete understanding of galaxy evolution requires knowledge of the obscured growth of supermassive black holes through cosmic time, out to the redshifts where the first galaxies form. X-ray emission is the most reliable way to reveal accreting black holes, but deep survey speed must improve by a factor ~100 over current facilities to perform a full census into the early Universe. The Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics (Athena+) mission provides the necessary performance (e.g. angular resolution, spectral resolution, survey grasp) to address these questions and revolutionize our understanding of the Hot and Energetic Universe. These capabilities will also provide a powerful observatory to be used in all areas of astrophysics.',\n",

This implies that an antimatter particle has exactly the same mass and absolute value of charge as its particle counterpart.

These atoms are amenable to precision laser spectroscopy, the results of which can in principle be used to determine the antiproton-to-electron mass ratio and to constrain the equality between the antiproton and proton charges and masses. Here we report two-photon spectroscopy of antiprotonic helium, in which $\\\\bar{p}{\\\\rm ^3He^+}$ and $\\\\bar{p}{\\\\rm ^4He^+}$ isotopes are irradiated by two counter-propagating laser beams. This excites nonlinear, two-photon transitions of the antiproton of the type $(n,\\\\ell)\\\\rightarrow (n-2,\\\\ell-2)$ at deep-ultraviolet wavelengths ($λ$=139.8, 193.0 and 197.0nm), which partly cancel the Doppler broadening of the laser resonance caused by the thermal motion of the atoms.

By comparing the results with three-body quantum electrodynamics calculations, we derived an antiproton-to-electron mass ratio of 1,836.1526736(23), where the parenthetical error represents one standard deviation. This agrees with the proton-to-electron value known to a similar precision.',\n",

       " \"As the only directly imaged multiple planet system, HR 8799 provides a unique opportunity to study the physical properties of several planets in parallel. In this paper, we image all four of the HR 8799 planets at H-band and 3.3 microns with the new LBT adaptive optics system, PISCES, and LBTI/LMIRCam. Our images offer an unprecedented view of the system, allowing us to obtain H and 3.3$ micron photometry of the innermost planet (for the first time) and put strong upper-limits on the presence of a hypothetical fifth companion. We find that all four planets are unexpectedly bright at 3.3 microns compared to the equilibrium chemistry models used for field brown dwarfs, which predict that planets should be faint at 3.3 microns due to CH4 opacity. We attempt to model the planets with thick-cloudy, non-equilibrium chemistry atmospheres, but find that removing CH4 to fit the 3.3 micron photometry increases the predicted L' (3.8 microns) flux enough that it is inconsistent with observations. In an effort to fit the SED of the HR 8799 planets, we construct mixtures of cloudy atmospheres, which are intended to represent planets covered by clouds of varying opacity. In this scenario, regions with low opacity look hot and bright, while regions with high opacity look faint, similar to the patchy cloud structures on Jupiter and L/T transition brown-dwarfs. Our mixed cloud models reproduce all of the available data, but self-consistent models are still necessary to demonstrate their viability.\",\n",

Furthermore the essential spectrum, in the absence of signal, is built from roots of unity (\"clock\" distribution). These results are independent of the statistical properties of the noise that can be Gaussian, non-Gaussian, pink or even without second moment (Levy). The presence of the signal has for effect to break the clock angular distribution of the essential spectrum on the unit circle. A discontinuity, proportional to the intensity of the signal, appears in the angular distribution. The sensitivity of this method is definitely better than standard techniques. We build an example that supports our claims.',\n",

       " \"The Vela-D region, according to the nomenclature given by Murphy & May (1991), of the star forming complex known as the Vela Molecular Ridge (VMR), has been recently analyzed in details by Olmi et al.

This survey's primary goal was to identify the coldest, dense dust cores possibly associated with the earliest phases of star formation. In this work, the dynamical state of the Vela-D cores is analyzed. Comparison to dynamical masses of a sub-sample of the Vela-D cores estimated from the 13CO survey of Elia et al. (2007), is complicated by the fact that the 13CO linewidths are likely to trace the lower density intercore material, in addition to the dense gas associated with the compact cores observed by BLAST. In fact, the total internal pressure of these cores, if estimated using the 13CO linewidths, appears to be higher than the cloud ambient pressure. If this were the case, then self-gravity and surface pressure would be insufficient to bind these cores and an additional source of external confinement (e.g., magnetic field pressure) would be required. However, if one attempts to scale down the 13CO linewidths, according to the observations of high-density tracers in a small sample of sources, then most proto-stellar cores would result effectively gravitationally bound.\",\n",
       " 'The deposition of mechanical feedback from a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an active galactic nucleus (AGN) into the surrounding galaxy occurs via broad-line winds which must carry mass and radial momentum as well as energy. The effect can be summarized by the dimensionless parameter $η=dot{M_outflow}/dot{M_accretion}= (2 ε_w c^2)/v_w^2$ where ($\\\\epslion_w \\\\equiv dot{E}_w/(dot{M_accretion} c^2)$) is the efficiency by which accreted matter is turned into wind energy in the disc surrounding the central SMBH. The outflowing mass and omentum are proportional to $η$, and many prior treatments have essentially assumed that $η=0$. We perform one- and two-dimensional simulations and find that the growth of the central SMBH is very sensitive to the inclusion of the mass and momentum driving but is insensitive to the assumed mechanical efficiency. For example in representative calculations, the omission of momentum and mass feedback leads to an hundred fold increase in the mass of the SMBH to over $10^{10} \\\\Msun$. When allowance is made for momentum driving, the final SMBH mass is much lower and the wind efficiencies which lead to the most observationally acceptable results are relatively low with $ε_w \\\\lesssim 10^{-4}$.',\n",

This combination of data allows us to determine the temperature, luminosity and mass of each BLAST core, and also enables us to separate starless from proto-stellar sources. We also analyze the effects that the uncertainties on the derived physical parameters of the individual sources have on the overall physical properties of starless and proto-stellar cores, and we find that there appear to be a smooth transition from the pre- to the proto-stellar phase. In particular, for proto-stellar cores we find a correlation between the MIPS24 flux, associated with the central protostar, and the temperature of the dust envelope. We also find that the core mass function of the Vela-D cores has a slope consistent with other similar (sub)millimeter surveys.',\n",

Beside these bound states, there is an essential spectrum sitting on the unit circle which represents the noise. In this picture, signal and noise are clearly separated and identified in the complex plane. Furthermore, we show that the J-transform enjoys the exceptional feature of lossless undersampling.

We focus on the prospects for using CMB measurements to differentiate various inflationary mechanisms. In particular, a detection of primordial B-mode polarization would demonstrate that inflation occurred at a very high energy scale, and that the inflaton traversed a super-Planckian distance in field space. We explain how such a detection or constraint would illuminate aspects of physics at the Planck scale. Moreover, CMB measurements can constrain the scale-dependence and non-Gaussianity of the primordial fluctuations and limit the possibility of a significant isocurvature contribution. Each such limit provides crucial information on the underlying inflationary dynamics. Finally, we quantify these considerations by presenting forecasts for the sensitivities of a future satellite experiment to the inflationary parameters.',\n",
       " '  We propose a new method in the spectral analysis of noisy time-series data for damped oscillators. From the Jacobi three terms recursive relation for the denominators of the Padé Approximations built on the well-known Z-transform of an infinite time-series, we build an Hilbert space operator, a J-Operator, where each bound state (inside the unit circle in the complex plane) is simply associated to one damped oscillator while the continuous spectrum of the J-Operator, which lies on the unit circle itself, is shown to represent the noise. Signal and noise are thus clearly separated in the complex plane. For a finite time series of length 2N, the J-operator is replaced by a finite order J-Matrix J_N, having N eigenvalues which are time reversal covariant. Different classes of input noise, such as blank (white and uniform), Gaussian and pink, are discussed in detail, the J-Matrix formalism allowing us to efficiently calculate hundreds of poles of the Z-transform. Evidence of a universal behaviour in the final statistical distribution of the associated poles and zeros of the Z-transform is shown. In particular the poles and zeros tend, when the length of the time series goes to infinity, to a uniform angular distribution on the unit circle. Therefore at finite order, the roots of unity in the complex plane appear to be noise attractors. We show that the Z-transform presents the exceptional feature of allowing lossless undersampling and how to make use of this property. A few basic examples are given to suggest the power of the proposed method.',\n",

This opens the experimental possibility of an observation of fractional charges with internal structure, close to the magnetic length scale.

Conventionally these models have quadratic sufficient statistics and consequently capture correlations arising from pairwise interactions. In this work we study extensions of these to models with higher-order sufficient statistics, modeling behavior on a social network with peer-group effects. In particular, we model binary outcomes on a network as a higher-order spin glass, where the behavior of an individual depends on a linear function of their own vector of covariates and some polynomial function of the behavior of others, capturing peer-group effects. Using a {\\\\em single}, high-dimensional sample from such model our goal is to recover the coefficients of the linear function as well as the strength of the peer-group effects.

       " 'GANs for time series data often use sliding windows or self-attention to capture underlying time dependencies. While these techniques have no clear theoretical justification, they are successful in significantly reducing the discriminator size, speeding up the training process, and improving the generation quality. In this paper, we provide both theoretical foundations and a practical framework of GANs for high-dimensional distributions with conditional independence structure captured by a Bayesian network, such as time series data. We prove that several probability divergences satisfy subadditivity properties with respect to the neighborhoods of the Bayes-net graph, providing an upper bound on the distance between two Bayes-nets by the sum of (local) distances between their marginals on every neighborhood of the graph. This leads to our proposed Subadditive GAN framework that uses a set of simple discriminators on the neighborhoods of the Bayes-net, rather than a giant discriminator on the entire network, providing significant statistical and computational benefits. We show that several probability distances including Jensen-Shannon, Total Variation, and Wasserstein, have subadditivity or generalized subadditivity. Moreover, we prove that Integral Probability Metrics (IPMs), which encompass commonly-used loss functions in GANs, also enjoy a notion of subadditivity under some mild conditions. Furthermore, we prove that nearly all f-divergences satisfy local subadditivity in which subadditivity holds when the distributions are relatively close. Our experiments on synthetic as well as real-world datasets verify the proposed theory and the benefits of subadditive GANs.',\n",
       " 'We identify the first static credible mechanism for multi-item additive auctions that achieves a constant factor of the optimal revenue. This is one instance of a more general framework for designing two-part tariff auctions, adapting the duality framework of Cai et al [CDW16]. Given a (not necessarily incentive compatible) auction format $A$ satisfying certain technical conditions, our framework augments the auction with a personalized entry fee for each bidder, which must be paid before the auction can be accessed. These entry fees depend only on the prior distribution of bidder types, and in particular are independent of realized bids. Our framework can be used with many common auction formats, such as simultaneous first-price, simultaneous second-price, and simultaneous all-pay auctions. If all-pay auctions are used, we prove that the resulting mechanism is credible in the sense that the auctioneer cannot benefit by deviating from the stated mechanism after observing agent bids. If second-price auctions are used, we obtain a truthful $O(1)$-approximate mechanism with fixed entry fees that are amenable to tuning via online learning techniques. Our results for first price and all-pay are the first revenue guarantees of non-truthful mechanisms in multi-dimensional environments; an open question in the literature [RST17].',\n",

Thus, to learn a good mechanism, it suffices to learn approximate distributions. When item values are independent, learning in Prokhorov distance is immediate, hence our framework directly implies the main result of Gonczarowski and Weinberg \\\\cite{GonczarowskiW18}. When item values are sampled from more general graphical models, we combine our robustness theorem with novel sample complexity results for learning Markov Random Fields or Bayesian Networks in Prokhorov distance, which may be of independent interest.

       " \"Statistical learning theory has largely focused on learning and generalization given independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples. Motivated by applications involving time-series data, there has been a growing literature on learning and generalization in settings where data is sampled from an ergodic process. This work has also developed complexity measures, which appropriately extend the notion of Rademacher complexity to bound the generalization error and learning rates of hypothesis classes in this setting. Rather than time-series data, our work is motivated by settings where data is sampled on a network or a spatial domain, and thus do not fit well within the framework of prior work. We provide learning and generalization bounds for data that are complexly dependent, yet their distribution satisfies the standard Dobrushin's condition. Indeed, we show that the standard complexity measures of Gaussian and Rademacher complexities and VC dimension are sufficient measures of complexity for the purposes of bounding the generalization error and learning rates of hypothesis classes in our setting. Moreover, our generalization bounds only degrade by constant factors compared to their i.i.d. analogs, and our learnability bounds degrade by log factors in the size of the training set.\",\n",
